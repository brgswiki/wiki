<h2>Important Pages</h2>
<p>Here is a list of all our important pages! These <strong>must </strong>be read through before you decide to start editing and creating pages - we will not accept ignorance as an excuse especially for breaking our more serious rules.</p>
<p>If you have already read our rules and guidelines but need a quick refresher there is also a short summary of all the important info below.</p>
<h3><a href="https://brgswiki.tk/rules">Rules</a></h3>
<p>This is the most important page and needs to be read through carefully before you are set free on the wiki. These are general rules and some of them should just be common sense. We won't be too harsh on improper English however some of our more serious rules such as being blatantly offensive or disrespecting other people's privacy will be dealt with severely.</p>
<h3><a href="https://brgswiki.tk/editing">Guidelines</a></h3>
<p>This is a quick helpful guide on how to work the wiki! Do not be afraid to send us questions or ask for help, it can be quite difficult at first but it is quick and easy to get into the hang of.</p>
<h3><a href="https://brgswiki.tk/editing/helpful-tips">Page Content</a></h3>
<p>Unsure what you are supposed to add to a page? Read through here! It contains a quick summary of what you can add to a page and some examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you think you know what to add have a quick check just to make sure that it doesn't breach any rules and will fit the style of the wiki.</p>
<h3><a href="https://brgswiki.tk/editing/hierarchy">Hierarchy</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, to keep the wiki a safe and positive community we need some kind of hierarchy. Once you have registered an account you should be able to do most things, yet we have moderators and admins in place to keep you safe, and make sure the wiki is free from any vandalism or bullying.</p>
<h3><a href="https://brgswiki.tk/request-verification">Request Verification</a></h3>
<p>Congratulations! You've made it! You are now ready to create an account and begin editing on the BRGS Wiki.</p>
