<h2>Intake 20 Events</h2>
<p>Since this is not only a <a href="/students/intake20">year 7</a> year group, but also the intake of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">coronavirus pandemic</a> this year group are yet to experience any <a href="/groups/trips">trips</a> or <a href="/groups/events">events</a> but can only hear glorified tales of drunk teachers or cardboard tasting food from older students. Either way, if you feel there is anything worthy of being classed as an event in these trying times do feel free to add them.</p>
