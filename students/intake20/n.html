<h2>20N</h2>
<p>20N joined BRGS in 2020. They will forever be remembered as the form who got sent home first as a result of coronavirus, having been at BRGS for only shortly longer than a week, although not much longer as about 70-99% of the school followed in their footsteps (and that is not including the Lockdown during the start of 2021).</p>
