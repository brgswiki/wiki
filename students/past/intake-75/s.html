<h2>75S</h2>
<p>“Do a report”, the teacher said.</p>
<p>How easy, I though, till I got to bed…</p>
<p>I forgot to do it earlier on in the night,</p>
<p>So I am lying here thinking just what to write.</p>
<p>Now how can I start and who can I mention?</p>
<p>Leave out the ones who have been in detention,</p>
<p>If I did that there would be nothing to write,</p>
<p>Because nearly everyone has been kept in at night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To Let - a spacious form room, number 28. Furniture consisting of lockers, tables, chairs and two large cupboards.</p>
<p>Condition - Good as new. Hardly been used, (due to the fact that it is a rare occasion when the occupants are allowed in).</p>
<p>Reason for Offer - The present tenants are being forced to move elsewhere after their long term residence of two and a half years.</p>
<p>Situated - Overlooking the tennis courts; complete with a magnificent view of Waterfoot</p>
