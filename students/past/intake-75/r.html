<h2>75R</h2>
<p>"Perched on a rocky ledge, high amongst the wild hills of Rossendale, lies a small but significant school. The heart of this education complex is Room 1, aptly named, as it contains the number one form - 4R. This form exceeds any teacher's wildest dreams. It contains a well-balanced mixture of brain-power, talent, and good personality, which is held together by a strong sense of unity which has held the form together through thick and thin for three and a half years. The teacher given the honour of being in charge of this wonderful group of young people is Mr Fuller."</p>
<p>“It is with deepest regret that we inform you of the impending break-up of 5R, who, after 5 years of detention, tests, exams, and homework, are nearing their misfortunate end.”</p>
