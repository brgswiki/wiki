<h2>75G</h2>
<p>“The hideout for the 2G Gangsters is on the balcony. The room is known to the underworld as the Geography Room, where we have various weapons such as fossils, atlases and maps, which are useful in fighting off other forms who frequently invade us. Our room us directly over the men's staff room. The members of the dreaded staff are often sending their double-agent up to spy on us, her code name being Miss Blezard. Every morning she comes up to our hideout and secretly finds out how many of out gang are still alive, by a method known as registration. Even though the staff keep a close watch on us every day they cannot defeat us! We are armed!… Between them they manage to keep the teachers under control as they creep around the school in their black cromby coats and trilby hats.”</p>
