<h2>76G</h2>
<p>“We are the 3G crime squad. Our headquarters is Room 7, which is disguised as a sewing room. There are 31 fully trained spies, who send back information from all over school…. We send spies out who pretend to play hockey (really their hockey sticks are guns in disguise)… In order that the teachers do not get suspicious we have trained W Porter and D Shufflebottom to work hard and achieve good results. This will please the teachers and they will not discover out spy network.”</p>
<p>“There are a few rumours saying that 4G run riot when they are off duty, making everyone's lives a misery. These nasty, vicious rumours are completely false and should be ignored.”</p>
