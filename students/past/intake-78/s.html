<h2>78S</h2>
<p>A very musical form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"ACCOMMODATION REQUIRED: Due to a few minor problems in Room 11, (dry rot, wet rot, woodworm and dandruff), it has been decided that the room should be closed for repairs. Unfortunately, the room is occupied by 33 more problems - 78S. Therefore, the question arose: is it worth repairing the room, or should we bung it (78S included, of course) into the nearest large, black hole? The latter decision, however, was opposed by the Rossendale Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Large Black Holes!</p>
<p>This form (homeless, unwanted, unloved) consists of 33 peoople, or some (distantly) related human species headed by Mr Fuller."</p>
