<h2>77G</h2>
<p>â€œOur class is split up into three main groups; the fairly intelligent specimens, the average, more loquacious members, and the people who are just there casually dismembering lockers."</p>
<p>"English Language Paper 1&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Two and a half minutes)</p>
<p>Careless and untidy work will be generously rewarded. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions below it.</p>
<p>It was a bad year; even with the untimely death of the Butty Club and the arrival of the Manning's Pie Association, nothing could rival the disappointment in Room 31, when it was announced the last member of the Magic Circle passed away due to acute boredom. Not everything was completely hopeless though; many of the thirty one members still employed their dinner hours fairly usefully; the other lunchtime activity was practised by the 5G nutter, who spent most of his time repeating old Monty Python sketches (<i>he </i>shall remain nameless). It may interest the reader (but probably won't) to know that 5G's form teacher that year was Mr Collinge.</p>
<p>Now answer the following questions.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hello.</li>
  <li>Summarise Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' (answer in no more than two of your own words)</li>
  <li>Do you like Chinese food?"</li>
</ol>
