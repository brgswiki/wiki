<h2>77R</h2>
<p>In Year 8 their form tutor took them to see a play ('The Witch that Nicked Christmas') - if only form tutors would do stuff like this nowadays!</p>
<p>"After 5 years of torment in the dungeons of BRGS, we decided it was time to escape. Field-Marshall Pretty's tortures had taken their toll, not forgetting the worst, most agonising torture of examsâ€¦ we had had enough.</p>
<p>However, before escaping and to avoid suspicion, we had to participate in the most gruesome and horrific task of all, GCE exams. Many tried to opt out, saying that it was a mission impossible to do it and escape. The affliction of pain and suffering would take its toll, many argued, but with the sheer determination of a few, we decided we had to do it, to neutralise any form of suspicion.</p>
<p>After irritating months of revision, we took them and fled through our various escape routes. Many of us would be captured and returned for more suffering, some would fine work, and a few would laze around in the sun as far away as possible from BRGS."</p>
