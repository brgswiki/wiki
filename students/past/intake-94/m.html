<p>' "Police, help!" cried a distressed male voice. "My new mobile phone, it's gone!" He stormed off shouting, "I'm reporting this to Detective Young !" Bystanders, Martin, Terry and Crozier, private detectives moved in to investigate the crime scene. On a chair lay some discarded objects. a half eaten Cadbury's Dairy Milk, a mysteriously ripped swimming cap and an empty Amin's carrier bag. We found more witnesses, a group of girls widely known as the sewing club. They knew of the stolen' mobile phone, They said a shadow had been spotted near to the crime scene minutes before the event. The shadow had dumped the items on the chair. "It's obvious!" exclaimed Terry, "The shadow was trying to frame the people linked with these objects." "Yes, I agree." murmured Martin. "We should be looking for someone who has nothing to do with these items." We looked around for more clues. All we could see was a scrawny looking sheep, that had somehow wandered into the building and one more person. That person was pacing up and down the corridor, looking very nervous. Every time a policeman walked by the person would bite their nails and try to sink into the background. "Well," said Crozier. "There are no more clues or evidence. We're only amateur detectives and there's nothing more we can do here." Terry, Martin and Crozier left the scene, puzzled. The mobile phone was never recovered and the victim, who wishes to remain anonymous dropped all charges. So who committed the crime? We'll let you decide.'</p>
