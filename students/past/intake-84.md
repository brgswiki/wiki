## Intake 1984
The intake of '84 joined in 1984 and left in 1989, or 1991 if they went to Sixth Form.

According to Mr Cairns, students from this year group were still able to use liquid mercury in science lessons and flicked it at each other, hence all the little scars in the woodwork in the older science labs!
