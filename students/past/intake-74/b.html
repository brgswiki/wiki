<h2>74B</h2>
<p>“The last week before School closed for Christmas, we decorated out form room. Balloons and long strips of crepe paper were hung around the walls, blackboard, notice board, and windows.”</p>
<p>“Deep inside the Rossendale Forest is a large building which hides all sorts of macabre secrets. If any intrepid explorers dare venture inside they will find tribes and habits undisturbed for millions of years. The building (known to locals as BRGS) seems to be a meeting place… One of the most barbaric and fierce tribes is known as 3B. Each day 3B meet in one allocated spot where Mr Baker writes names on a clay tablet, and quietens the wilder element with a nail-studded club."</p>
