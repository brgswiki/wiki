<h2>Intake 19 Events</h2>
<p>Here is a place to fill in any school trip or event pages with any of your own photos or memories from that event. These pages are meant as a student replacement for the photo galleries or news on the BRGS Website as they seem to be missing a lot of trips and events.</p>
<p>This year group won't have yet experienced many events or trips as unfortunately coronavirus lockdown resulted in them missing most of the Year 7 events.</p>
