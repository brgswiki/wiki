<h2>Waterfoot Field Trip 2019</h2>
<p>Pretty much the same as every other year -&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>A rainy day. <i><strong>check</strong></i></li>
  <li>Someone points to their house and gets told off by the teacher due to ‘data protection.’ <i><strong>check</strong></i></li>
  <li>Someone stands in dog poo and tries to wipe it all over their friends trousers. <i><strong>check</strong></i></li>
  <li>Takes twice as long to walk the short loop than it should do, due to the teachers wanting the trip to take a full hour. <i><strong>check</strong></i></li>
  <li>Wastes another 5 lessons in the computer room afterwards, making a ‘spectacular’ word document about the Environmental Quality of Waterfoot complete with graphs, charts and long conclusions. Just another item that no one looks at until it's time to through your books in the bin at the end of the year. <i><strong>check</strong></i></li>
  <li>Wastes 2 lesson before the trip, learning what environmental quality actually means. <i><strong>check</strong></i></li>
</ul>
<p>So not too much to report, just the same as all previous years.</p>
