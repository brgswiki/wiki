<h2>Year 9 Camp 2022</h2>
<p>Year 9 Camp for Intake 19 fell on the hottest week in UK history. Chaos ensued, with water fights, battles for tent pitches in the shade and canoeing quickly turning into swimming just to survive the heat. In the true fashion of British weather, it quickly changed with downpours on the 3rd night and last day.&nbsp;</p>
