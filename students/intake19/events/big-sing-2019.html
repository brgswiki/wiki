<h2>Y7 Big Sing 2019</h2>
<p>Another year of school, another year of the infamous Big Sing and another year of fierce rivalry between <a href="/teachers/mr-webber">Mr Webber</a> and <a href="/teachers/mr-mercer">Mr Mercer</a>. As usual, the event consisted mainly of ukuleles and keyboards (carried to the venue by a poor <a href="/teachers/mr-davenport">Mr Davenport</a> and unsuspecting A-Level music students) and a few brave souls manned the guitars and drums.</p>
<p>A slight mess up by the SLT team and <a href="/subjects/music">Music Department</a> resulted in the venue changing from the canopy to the lower school dining hall. This was no bad thing, as in the hall, it felt suspiciously like there was a lot more space than in year assemblies. It's certainly not a bad way to fill an afternoonâ€¦</p>
<h3>Judges, Prizes and Winners</h3>
<p><a href="/teachers/past/mr-reeves">Reevsie</a> manned the shoes of host and judge. When it came to choose his favorite, he seemed rather nervous - not something you see in an everyday assembly!</p>
<p>The results were as follows:</p>
<p>Best Vocal - 7W (19W)</p>
<p>Best Instrumental - 7S (19S)</p>
<p>Best Overall - 7B (19B)</p>
<p>The prizes for each of the results were 3 Cadbury Heroes each. Singers got a bar of chocolate each (whether they could sing or not) and Reevsie's handpicked favorite performers were given special prizes.&nbsp;</p>
