<h2>Y7 Big Sing 2019</h2>
<p>Another year of school, another year of the infamous Big Sing and another year of fierce rivalry between Mr Webber and Mr Mercer. As usual, the event consisted mainly of ukuleles and keyboards (carried to the venue by a poor Mr Davenport and unsuspecting A-Level music students) and a few brave souls manned the guitars and drums.</p>
<p>A slight mess up on the SLT team and Music Department's behalf resulted in the venue changing from the canopy to the lower school dining hall. This was no bad thing, as in the hall, it felt suspiciously like there was a lot more space than in year assemblies. It's certainly not a bad way to fill an afternoonâ€¦</p>
<h3>Judges, Prizes and Winners</h3>
<p>Reevsie manned the shoes of host and judge. When it came to choose his favorite, he seemed rather nervous - not something you see in an everyday assembly!</p>
<p>The results were as follows:</p>
<p>Best Vocal - 7W (now 8W)</p>
<p>Best Instrumental - 7S (now 8S)</p>
<p>Best Overall - 7B (now 8B)</p>
<p>The prizes for each of the results were 3 Cadbury Heroes each. Singers got a bar of chocolate each (whether they could sing or not) and Reevsie's handpicked favorite performers were given special prizes.&nbsp;</p>
