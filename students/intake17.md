## Year 11
Year 11 is the year in which you take your GCSEs (unless of course a deadly virus sweeping the world results in them getting cancelled... as if that would happen)

In Year 11 you have the same classes and teachers as Year 10, and all in all Year 11 is rather similar to Year 10 just 1480x more stressful.

The current Year 11 joined in 2017, and their Head of Year is [Mr Chambers](/teachers/mr-chambers).
