Year 9s are on the whole less cocky than both years before them. This is also the year you choose your GCSE options, although most people regret these by Year 10 and change them to another subject they regret just as much.

In Year 9 rather than being in forms for your classes you are put in a mixed group, with roughly 5 people from each form. You are in these classes for every subject apart from the language you chose in Year 8 and one drama lesson a fortnight.

The current Year 9 joined in 2017, and their Head of Year is [Mr Chambers](/teachers/mr-chambers).
