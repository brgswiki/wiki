<h2>16S</h2>
<p>16S joined BRGS in 2016 and left in 2021, with most students moving on to Sixth Form.</p>
<p>Miss Ingham, upon her return, is still able to name every member of the form even after not having seen us for 4 years. Supposedly we are her second favourite form that she's ever had (behind some Yr 11 form at her other school).</p>
