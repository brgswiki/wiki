<h2>16S</h2>
<p>16S is currently a Year 11 form. They joined BRGS in 2016 and their current form tutor is 90% <a href="/teachers/mr-wilbraham">Mr Wilbraham</a> and 10% <a href="/teachers/mrs-sawle">Mrs Sawle</a>.</p>
<p>Miss Ingham, upon her return, is still able to name every member of the form even after not having seen us for 4 years. Supposedly we are her second favourite form that she's ever had (behind some Yr 11 form at her other school).</p>
