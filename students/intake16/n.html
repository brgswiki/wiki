<p>16N is currently a Year 11 form. They joined BRGS in 2016 and their current form tutor is <a href="/teachers/dr-heaton">Dr Heaton</a>. Their form room was C112 (in Year 10) until it got flooded or wrecked in some other peculiar way and has been rendered out of use for a year or so. Their form room was then moved to N88 that year.</p>
