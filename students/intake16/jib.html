<h2>12JIB</h2>
<p>12JIB is a Year 12 tutor group. Their form tutor is <a href="/teachers/mrs-buckley">Mrs Buckley</a>. They have punished for an unknown crime by being given the smallest room (C101) in school which sadly always has one chair less than members of the form present that day. Fortunately we have now moved over to a business studies room in the main building.</p>
