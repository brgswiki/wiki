<p>16B is currently a Year 10 form. They joined BRGS in 2016 and their current form tutor is <a href="/teachers/miss-butterworth">Miss Butterworth</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, all their form rooms have been in the hall and therefore cannot leave for first period until assembly is over, and cannot talk too loud during form time.</p>
