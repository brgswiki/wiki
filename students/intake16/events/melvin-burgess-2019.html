<p>Intake 16's Year 9 author visit was from the world renowned Melvin Burgess who actually just lives just down the road in Hebden Bridge so was actually probably just the cheapest for the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He became a running joke for Intake 16 for at least a few months as it was all the English teachers wouldn't stop talking about him so we had to make the most of a bad situation.</p>
<p>Some of his book titles include 'Junk' and 'The Hit' and most of them are unsurprisingly about drugs or other issues old people believe teenagers face on a daily basis.</p>
<p>As he resides in Hebden Bridge any Todmorden or Hebden-dwelling folk may have spotted him - especially if they shop in the Tod Morrisons as he seems to be there every day buying tinned vegetables and cat food and nothing else, leading many to wonder if he has rather a peculiar diet.</p>
