<h2>Intake 18 Events</h2>
<p>Here is a place to fill in any school trip or event pages with any of your own photos or memories from that event. These pages are meant as a student replacement for the photo galleries or news on the BRGS Website as they seem to be missing a lot of trips and events and getting a little rusty with adding new articles.</p>
