# Year 8
Year 8s are possibly even cockier than Year 7s, because they are no longer the youngest year in school. None of the other years really pay much attention to year 8s depite their best efforts for attention.

In Year 8 you begin to branch out a bit more and make more friends from other forms.

The current Year 8 joined in 2018, and their Head of Year is Mr Grehan (who doesn't like them much because they keep starting fights).
