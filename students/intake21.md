## Year 7
Each year the Year 7s get smaller and cockier. When you are in Year 7 you're likely to get irritated by the number of times you pass older kids in the corridor and they're all like "aww look at the cute year 7s", and then once you join year 8 you do the exact same. 

In Year 7 you are likely to just know the people in your form, and the first few weeks are always pretty awkward but you soon settle into the swing of things.

In the past, older students would wrap newer students in rugs and then put them down the coal shute from [Room 7](/groups/rooms/science/7) to the boilerhouse... keep this in mind before being cocky to us older years, don't give us ideas...

The current Year 7 joined in 2021, and their Head of Year is [Mrs Bowdler](/teachers/mrs-bowdler).
