## Year 12
This is the first year of Sixth Form, and many people continue from the Lower School. You usually take about 4 subjects, then drop one during the first term.

The current Year 12 either joined in 2016 or 2021, and their Head of Year is [Mrs Walsh](/teachers/mrs-walsh).

In lower school, their Head of Year was [Mrs Bowdler](/teachers/mrs-bowdler), and they were the last year to have a Halloween disco and the first to have the same Head of Year all 5 years.
