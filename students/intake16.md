## Year 10
In Year 10 most people are stressing about their GCSEs and then half way through the year you just give up worrying and have decided come what may, and then rather than putting effort in you'll just live life to the fullest. This high only lasts a week or so before you come back to reality as all teachers talk about is GCSEs or how much they hate their kids.

In Year 10 you are setted for all core subjects, and you have the same teachers as you'd have in Year 11. This year unfortunately has a disappointly low number of trips as Blackpool was replaced by work experience and DofE is just a 2 day hike.

The current Year 10 joined in 2016, and their Head of Year is [Mrs Bowdler](/teachers/mrs-bowdler).
