<h1>Hello and welcome to the new BRGS Wiki</h1>
<p>Hello there! You have found the new BRGS Wiki, congratulations. We are a collaborative community from BRGS hoping to build a humorous database and yearbook type site - with your help!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This site is an update of the old BRGS Wiki and we are in the process of bringing the two together. This site is an area for you to record anything you wish about BRGS, from lessons to school trips to inside jokes.</p>
<p>There is lots you can do - feel free to have a browse or dive straight in!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please contact us if you have any queries, we are a friendly bunch and will always be happy to help!</p>
