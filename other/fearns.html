<h2>Fearns</h2>
<p>Technically now Valley Leadership Academy as the name 'Fearns' had too many bad connotations, although everyone still calls it Fearns anyway. You can't spell Fearns without fear, even if you attend the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A proud rivalry exists between BRGS and Fearns, summed up by the message left on one of the stone globes adorning the steps of the staff carpark: "I hate u gramma school".</p>
<p>Fearns has got an equestrian centre, or so they want us to think. In reality, they have formed a cavalry to fight against us. Hopefully the BRGS gates will be locked when they charge. They also have a nuclear bunker next to the Astro Turf to compete with the Dark Lord headteacher's particle accelerator.</p>
<h3>Snowballs</h3>
<p>It is true that snowball fights <i>may</i> have occurred between BRGS and Fearns. It is said that if a single snowflake falls within a 3 mile radius of the school, all pupils are sent home immediately, and for Fearns, "home" is "BRGS" so they can pelt us with snowballs. Teachers at BRGS are strongly against snowball fights between pupils, however, <a href="/teachers/mr-vincent">Mr Vincent</a> once joined in with a snowball fight, and helped BRGS repel the pupils of Fearns. This is strong evidence to suggest the rivalry has spread to the teachers as well as pupils.</p>
