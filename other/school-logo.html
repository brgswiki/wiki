<h2>The Squirrel Logo</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right image_resized" style="width:31.2%;"><img src="/brgs_logo.png"></figure>
<p>Maurice the Squirrel is the school mascot and appears everywhere. He appears on a number of uniform items. Or, if you have looked in the cupboard outside <a href="/teachers/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a>' <a href="/groups/rooms/office/18">office</a>, you will have seen various items such as golf balls, beer mugs, and business card holders embezzled with the logo. Rumoured to be <a href="/teachers/mr-spencer">Mr Spencer</a> in disguise.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Ever wondered if there is an actual reason why the logo is a squirrel? Well, you are lucky - there are a number of <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> teacher level analysed parts of the logo.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In September 1928 the school became known as Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School, and in the following year the present badges were introduced. The designs, the work of Mr. Barker, the <a href="/subjects/art">Art</a> master, are explained here! - "Predominant is the Squirrel, this animal has been chosen for the following reasons. In the first place, it is a charge that exists on the Coats-of-Arms of both Bacup and Rawtenstall, and secondly it symbolises the virtues industry, foresight and agility (not entirely sure if this last part is just English language level waffle, as I'm pretty sure squirrels just run around burying acorns then forget where they put them).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Separated from it by a riband, bearing the school motto, Fide et Labore, is a space occupied by three Tudor roses; three Lancastrian roses, as will be seen by their colour, and representing the three school Houses, Bacup, Rawtenstall and Waterfoot (which are no longer in place).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>"All three devices are arranged in a panel of shield shape, the border of which has a line of colour, either red, white or blue, according to the particular house to which its owner belongs. Arranged around this shield are two boughs of laurel in wreath formation, included as being emblematic of glory that is, in the sense of achievement, and also perhaps because it is a shapely plant and a never-failing stand-by to the designer for filling odd corners. The background of the roses and the squirrel, also parts of the squirrel, are in the school colours, navy-blue and amber.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Congrats to those who read all this. If you ever need help analysing something for English just follow this structure.</p>
