<h2>BRGS Ready</h2>
<p>“BRGS ready” is a pretentious little phrase used mostly by a handful of teachers to be obnoxious about not having a working whiteboard pen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one really knows where the phrase originated, although likely SLT in an attempt to provide even more pitfalls for students to get penalty points or something else to print off on posters and laminate to stick around school corridors and classrooms alongside the defamed and graffitied ‘growth mindset’ posters.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the phrase seems to have slowly disappeared over the years, possibly due to none of the teachers actually knowing what the teachers are at any one time, thanks to <a href="/teachers/mr-johnstone">Mr Johnstone's</a> love of keeping everyone on their feet.</p>
