<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>Most teachers will tell you that you are supposed to get an hour of homework a night (excluding weekends), if you do your homework the night it is set. This however is rarely true. Some days you are set no homework, some days you are set seven hours! Homework you are told ‘will only last 5 minutes’ is almost always a lie, and others where teachers say they expect you to spend at least an hour on it you often finish much quicker than expected.</p>
<p>At the start of your planner you can see how much homework you are expected to get for each subject, but these are massive overestimates unless you do art, and in that case it is an underestimate.</p>
<h3>Year 7</h3>
<p>In <a href="/students/intake20">year 7</a>, you may think you get a lot of homework because you are fresh out of primary school and you get very little/no homework in primary school. You are, however, mistaken. There are probably at least two days a month, if not more when you DON'T GET ANY HOMEWORK AT ALL. These days are to be cherished. They will soon disappear.</p>
<h3>Year 8</h3>
<p>Pretty much the same as year 7. You are not allowed to complain about language homework until you are given two sides of gobbledygook (ie <a href="/subjects/french">French</a>, <a href="/subjects/spanish">Spanish</a> or <a href="/subjects/german">German</a>) and are told to learn it all by heart, or to write an essay for the next day.</p>
<h3>Year 9</h3>
<p>Towards the middle/end of the year, you'll get a lot of <a href="/subjects/history">history</a> homework, however some teachers (<a href="/teachers/past/mrs-appleton-why">Mrs Appleton-Why</a>) don't make you do it if you're choosing <a href="/subjects/geography">geography</a> - and who would rather be writing essays than colouring and sticking in in some maps.</p>
<h3>Year 10</h3>
<p>You get your first homework on the first day then later look at it in your planner, scream, faint, wake up, scream some more and run from the room in tears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some subjects, such as <a href="/subjects/drama">drama</a> seem like nice easy subjects because you seem to get no homework in the first week or so. You will spend the first fortnight pointing and laughing at your friends who took history and seem to be getting lots of homework. Then you soon come to realise that your life now revolves around drama, and any/every bit of spare time you have must be spent rehearsing. Even if it's not free time, it still must be spent rehearsing.</p>
<p>For subjects such as <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> and <a href="/subjects/maths">Maths</a>, the frequency that homework is set doesn't really change, but you are expected to spend longer on your homework than you had to in previous years.</p>
<h3>Year 11</h3>
<p>By now you are so showered under with homework you don't even know which subject is which. You have lost track of the days. Your planner is full of ink and doodles. Each morning you wake up to 17 new Google Classroom notifications. Your books are all over your bedroom floor. Loose sheets are lying around everywhere. You are down to a pen, a snapped pencil, a highlighter you found under the desk, and half a protractor. Somehow, you make it through the year, only to be greeted by revision, then GCSEs, then it starts all over with A-Levels.</p>
