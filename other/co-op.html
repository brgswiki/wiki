<h2>Co-op</h2>
<p>The largest shop in Waterfoot (which says a lot about the shops in Waterfoot), the Co-Operative shop is a good backup plan when you can't physically eat another chip. Or when you've got extra cash for lunch. Sometimes ridiculously cheap doughnuts can be found in a trolley at the front of the shop, this is sadly a rare occurrence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A fool-proof way to measure inflation is to watch how the price of Jelly Babies changes in the co-op.</p>
