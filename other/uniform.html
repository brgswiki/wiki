<h2>Uniform</h2>
<p>The lovely clothes made from 100% polyester and bearing a squirrel we have to wear on a daily basis. Other than the compulsory shirt/shoes/trousers/skirt/blazer there are some fine optional additions to any of these outfit combinations. Mr Porteous himself has a BRGS umbrella, along with a BRGS notebook and a BRGS coat. However, as bad as the uniform is now, we cannot complain as the previous students had to wear…</p>
<h3>Uniform through the ages - (to be trimmed down!)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1910s - The boys had no compulsory item of uniform except a navy blue cap with two yellow bands. On the other hand, the girls wore straw hats ("boaters", presumably) with a badge bearing the Latin motto "Abeunt studia in mores" surmounting a stag or deer. Gloves had to be worn, and clothing must be "suitable" in the view of the Headmistress. Hair must be plaited or tied back (definitely better than the just ‘no unnatural hair colours’ rule we have in place now, right?). During Prize-giving the girls were obliged to wear white dresses, white gloves, white (if any) hair ribbons, black shoes and stockings.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>1920s - girls wore a navy-blue gym-slip with box pleats, a white blouse, long black woollen stockings and navy-blue knickers. Outdoors they wore a dark-blue wool cap with two bands of yellow. An embroidered cloth badge was stitched to the front. Later, caps were replaced by blue felt hats with a blue and gold striped band. For the boys came the new cap, the famous "banana stripe" design. The new caps had broad orange-yellow vertical stripes from the edge, pointing towards the crown. BRGS attracted a good deal of ridicule from pupils of other schools who called us, aptly but derisively, 'Banana-stripes'. Unpopular though it was, this type of cap persisted until about the end of the 1940's.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>___________</li>
  <li>In September 1928 the school became known as Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School, and in the following year the present badges were introduced, The designs, the work of Mr. Barker, the Art master, were explained in the magazine. "Predominant is the Squirrel which animal has been chosen for the following reasons. In the first place, it is a charge that exists on the Coats-of-Arms of both Bacup and Rawtenstall, and secondly it symbolises the virtues industry, foresight and agility. Separated from it by a riband, bearing the school motto, Fide et Labore, is a space occupied by three Tudor roses three Lancastrian roses, as will be seen by their colour, and representing the three school Houses, Bacup, Rawtenstall and Waterfoot. "All three devices are arranged in a panel of shield shape, the border of which has a line of colour, either red, white or blue, according to the particular house to which its owner belongs. Arranged around this shield are two boughs of laurel in wreath formation, included as being emblematic of glory that is, in the sense of achievement, and also perhaps because it is a shapely plant and a never-failing stand-by to the designer for filling odd corners. The background of the roses and the squirrel, also parts of the squirrel, are in the school colours, navy-blue and amber. "At the same time a prefect's badge was introduced. Its fine symbolism reveals the qualities expected of a prefect in 1929: The Eye has from time immemorial been used to serve as a symbol of alertness, watchfulness and guardianship. The addition of wings presupposes the additional qualities of swiftness and ubiquity."&nbsp;</li>
  <li>1930s - you would have seen students in their new and colourful regalia, cap and hat badges, prefects' badges and badges for blazers, new caps for the boys and panama hats for the girls." The cap and hat badges were of enamelled metal, the blazer badge a larger version, woven in silk. A similar badge, worn by girls on the tunic, and boys on the jacket breast-pocket, bearing an appropriate sport symbol, denoted "colours" for a particular game. Another modification of the girls' 101 uniform requirements was the introduction of the Greek-style tunic for gym. A 1934 photograph shows girl athletes wearing such tunics, so it seems likely that they, too, appeared at about the time of the new badges and hats. Hitherto the girls had worn their navy tunics for gym, until the advent of Miss Peirson in 1923 The new gym mistress made the girls remove their tunics: it was then, in fact, that they could no longer be "on display" in the hall, but had to be hustled away to the lower regions and have gym in the versatile plumbing-room!&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Between 1929 and the second war, which of course put severe restrictions on clothing, there seem to have been few changes, except that at some stage a green jersey was introduced, to be worn under the tunic, for the girls. Boys were expected to wear either a waistcoat or a pullover: we are told that Mr. Holden objected to boys' being, as he expressed it "dressed for the beach". Mrs. Kathleen Gowers, who was a pupil in the second World War, describes the uniform of her time: "The girls' uniform consisted of navy-blue gym-tunic (box-pleated) over a jade-green jumper with a square neck and buttoning on the shoulder. However, with the war these jumpers were unavailable, and any suitable green jumper was allowed." Speaking of wartime shortages, Mrs. Gowers continues: "Somehow we all managed navy raincoats, black shoes and stockings. The school hat was always worn navy-blue velour (or cream panama for summer) with the navy and gold band and the metal squirrel hat-badge. Of course, the metal badge disappeared, as all metal was needed for the war effort.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>By 1945, hardly a hat was to be seen amongst the girls, though caps were still compulsory for boys. There were still green jerseys in evidence, but not for long. Miss Greenwood replaced Miss Iremonger in 1945, and with continuing clothes rationing it became a question of bringing the uniform into line as practically and cheaply as the circumstances allowed. Most girls in the upper school still possessed metal hat-badges, and a small stock of them still remained. It was decided that girls should wear plain navy-blue berets with the metal badge sewn on. Since the green jumper seemed to have little connection with school colours, and since the original ones were now unobtainable, a navy-blue jersey or cardigan became the rule, and the white shirt-blouse, with the amber-and-navy tie, continued to be worn with the tunic. This latter garment, which was being discarded by many schools, was eventually abandoned in favour of a navy-blue serge gored skirt. At first, this was for seniors, but parents soon objected ~justifiably) that their daughters, at eleven, could be as well-grown as many Fourth-formers, so eventually all girls wore skirt and blouse.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>A navy-and-white striped blouse was introduced for seniors in an endeavour to give them a small sense of 'privilege", and Fifth-formers were later permitted to wear pleated rather than gored skirts if they wished. There was also an abortive effort to clothe the girl prefects in "amber' '-coloured blouses, but the rather glaring yellow produced by the outfitters was not popular and the experiment was not continued. Miss Greenwood introduced a very attractive wool beret, navy with amberstriped headband, with a small cloth version of the school badge to stitch on the front, and an attractive little pompom on the top. This adornment became, of course, a natural target, and very few berets retained their pompoms for more than about a term, after which they soon looked shabby and disreputable (a sign of seniority, of course!).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, in Mr. Copley's headship, and with the relaxing, as time went on, of clothes rationing, the boys had been put into the uniform we see today. It was gradually introduced, of course, so as to cause no financial hardship: each new intake of boys was required to wear grey trousers (shorts for most eleven-year-olds in those days!) navy blazer with school badge. suitably-coloured shirt with school tie, suitable pullover if any, and of course school cap. If a top-coat was required. then boys. like girls, had to wear navy gabardine raincoats. Problems arose with girls' summer uniform. Any suitable dress could be worn - but of course not all were suitable! For a short time, Miss Greenwood had girls wearing (if one remembers correctly) "any stripe, any spot, any check or any plain colour," which eave some semblance of uniformity.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Then came self-colour dresses, pink, blue, green, which were quite attractive with their white collars and cuffs, until the non-fast colours (particularly the pink!) ran into the white collars and cuffs. The late 1950's brought pastel-coloured checked gingham dresses which washed limp and pathetic, needing starch to revive them. By that time girls were not particularly interested in dresses - it was the era of jeans. Mr. David Baldry recalls the Day of Liberation: "At the beginning of the Autumn Term 1964 Mr. Copley decreed that caps need not be worn any more. I must own one of the newest. In the Summer Term 1964, during horse-play at Bacup Baths, my cap ended up in the water and shrank - so I had to buy a new one! It was also in my first year that the new-style scarf was introduced. It cost a fortune - twenty-four shillings, I think." (The last-named article was the vertically-striped Saxony Wrap" as its tradename was, and it doubtless costs a great deal more now than one pound twenty pence!) Miss Dodds, Miss Greenwood's successor, had seen the demise of the woollen beret. and now came the decree that the boys need no longer wear caps.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Miss Dodds's successor, Miss Macleroy, knowing that most girls preferred to go hatless, suggested, as an alternative to wearing a beret, the small cap-badge affixed to the left breast of the raincoat. This seemed a simple (and certainly extremely cheap) method of identifying girls as members of the school. Amazingly, it created a veritable furore, but the decision was eventually ratified at a governors' meeting. Pleated skirts (so desirable when not uniform) were introduced for all forms. They at once became far less desirable. The green "Greek" tunics for gym. had by this time almost disappeared and a new gym. mistress (Miss Harrison, later Mrs. Wenter) was consulted as to her preferences for girls' P.E. uniform. Pleated navy shorts with short-sleeved cellular blouses became the regular wear, for gym tunics were no longer worn, and girls required something to wear for hockey and other outdoor exercise. 103 A Sixth-form tie had been introduced in the late 1950's - the "Squirrel" tie, with a squirrel motif between the stripes. It was very attractive and both boys and girls seemed willing to wear it. Sixth-form boys, in the early 1960's, were absolved from wearing uniform, apart from the tie, and allowed to appear in sports jackets instead of blazers. This suggested some similar distinction for Sixth-form girls, and Miss Macleroy introduced grey instead of navy for the Sixth. Summer uniform was still a problem. At a meeting of senior girls, the pupils selected a dark blue dress: dark, drab colours were the "in-thing" at that time. For juniors. a blue and yellow checked gingham was specially woven for the school, and dresses were made to measure by a Bury dressmaker, or the material could be purchased and made up at home. Mr. Clark's advent in 1969 put an end to the era of persecution by coat-badge. He endeavoured to introduce a navy felt Breton sailor hat. The girls loved these, but of course, would not wear them, as they were not compulsory.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>“To wear, voluntarily, an article of uniform which you are not obliged to have (especially something as eminently respectable as a hat!) may easily label you a CREEP, a TEACHER'S PET, or whatever the current term may be.” ~ some member of staff clearly not with the current lingo.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;So the pretty little hats, with their attractive yellow ribbon trim, were scarcely seen. The seniors' dark blue dresses were discontinued (without any notice at all) by the outfitters. A striped material, obtainable locally, was selected, but had to be made up at home. The local climate is not so overpoweringly warm, as a rule, as to make summer dresses an absolute necessity. The juniors' gingham dresses eventually suffered a similar fate when the dressmaker retired. Girls seem quite happy to continue wearing skirt and blouse (short sleeves now permitted in summer). Surprisingly, the useful, neat blazer is hardly ever worn by girls these days. Even in summer they are encased in anoraks. Thus, tieless, hatless and blazerless, they are, in summer, completely unidentifiable, which seems a pity. The uniform, if correctly worn, is as attractive as any, and the badge and tie remain unchanged for about thirty-five years.</li>
  <li>By the late 1960's, as we have seen, many more pupils were coming in to the Sixth-form from secondary modern schools. These newcomers had worn the Sixth-form uniform without complaint. However, two objections might fairly have been raised: first, the expense involved in the purchase of special items of dress for (usually) only two years; second, the fact that, if they had elected to go to a College of Further Education, no uniform would have been required.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Whatever may have been the considerations, in June 1972 it was decided that the Sixth should no longer be required to wear uniform. Initially there were certain guidelines laid down as to colour, style and so forth, but these were vague and rarely adhered to. A report in "Squirrel" on the 1970 Speech Day comments: "For some of us it was more like a mannequin parade, with former students displaying the latest fashions." Nowadays, with all Sixth-formers in mufti as well, the few deprived Fifthformers who have to cross the platform to receive prizes must feel like so many bantams amongst a flock of peacocks!</li>
