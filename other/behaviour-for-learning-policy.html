<h2>Behaviour For Learning Policy</h2>
<p>The <strong>Behaviour for Learning Policy</strong> is the new system started up by <a href="/teachers/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a> from September 2009. He spent an entire period explaining to everybody how the new system works. It has changed and been tweaked each year since. Perhaps recently some of the more drastic changes were seen with the change from record books to an online site, and when BRGS decided Vivo was too expensive they swapped it for their own achievement point system which can get you, at most: some certificates, skip to the front of the queue lunch passes (which is flawed as not everyone uses the canteen/canopy), and a chocolate bar if your Head of Year is feeling particularly generous.</p>
<h3>Ways to get Penalty Points</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bad uniform.</li>
  <li>Homework not being handed in</li>
  <li>Disruptive behaviour</li>
  <li>Forgetting equipment</li>
  <li>Forgetting exercise books</li>
  <li>Not being "BRGS Ready"</li>
  <li>Anything <a href="/teachers/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a> doesn't approve of really</li>
</ul>
<p>Supposedly, teachers "will give you the chance to correct your behaviour. You may at this point be moved, or given a few minutes outside to cool down. If your behaviour does not improve, the teacher will issue penalty points via the school network" (from the 'blue folder') however this act of kindness and believing in second chances is rarely seen and teachers are more likely to just straight up give you a penalty point.</p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>In the past getting no penalty points or having a high number of merits was rewarded with a trip such as laser tag or bowling, or at one point school even brought in an ice rink to the bottom astro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, rewards like this seem very out of reach and we can only dream of getting more than a certificate for our efforts. (However, some select few who get the most achievement points in their year group get to go to "High Tea with <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr P</a>" although this is out of the reach for the remaining 98.888% of the year.)</p>
<p>Note: people with the most achievement points are not actually those who have <i>earned </i>them, but simply those with teacher such as Miss Ogle or Ms Marti.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The majority of teachers (or at least the ones I've had) in the 2019/20 school year have admitted to not handing out achievement points as they consider having to log into the computer etc too much fuss, in fact a number of these said they handed out something like 3 in the first week and haven't done any since.</p>
<h3>Level 1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All students start every term on Level 0 with no penalty points. As you acquire penalty points and reach the first threshold (10 penalty points), you will be put into detention – after school on a Friday. This classes as Level 1. A letter will be sent home to your parents. Failure to attend detentions will lead to a day in isolation.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Level 2</h3>
<p>At 30 penalty points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Detention.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Your form tutor will write to your parents.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Form tutor’s report. You will be given a report-card which you must hand to each of your teachers at the beginning of each lesson each day, so that they can report on your behaviour.</li>
  <li>You will be on report for ten days.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You must achieve at least 70% “good” (or better) comments to be taken off report at the end of the fortnight. Your form tutor will move you down to Level 0.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Level 3</h3>
<p>At 50 penalty points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your form tutor will send you to see your Head of Year, who will write to your parent about your behaviour.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You will be given a detention.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You will be put on Head of Year report for ten days (as for form tutor report).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You will be required to hand your mobile phone in to your Head of Year each day you are on report.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You will serve three Head of Year detentions (each of 20 minutes).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If there is a radical improvement, the Head of Year could move you down to Level 0 for a fresh start, but if the misbehaviour continues, you will be moved to Level 4.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Level 4</h3>
<p>If you cross the next threshold (70 penalty points):&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will be put on Senior Leadership Team report for ten days, which operates in a similar manner to Head of Year report.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You will be required to report to the SLT member assigned to you each day.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You will be put in SLT detention for 6 days during this period (each of 20 minutes).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You will be given a detention.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Your parents will be informed.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If there is improvement, you will move back to Level 0; if not, you will go to Level 5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Level 5</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This happens quite rarely (90 penalty points) and each case will be dealt with individually. The sanctions involved will depend on the reasons behind the penalty points you have gained and could include specific mentoring, focussed reports, internal and/or external exclusions from school. (But whoo no detentions!) Your head of year, <a href="/teachers/mr-reeves">the deputy headteacher</a> and/or <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">headteacher</a> will be involved. It may be necessary to invite your parents into school for a discussion with the headteacher and possibly school governors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Well Known Penalty Point Givers</h2>
<h3><strong>Mr Reeves</strong></h3>
<p>Mr Reeves, it is his system, surely he will be enforcing it, can be known to spot bad uniform quickly so pupils quickly sort their uniform when going past him!</p>
<h2>Well Know Achievement Point Givers</h2>
<h3>Ms Marti</h3>
<p><a href="/teachers/ms-marti">Ms Marti</a> will give you achievement points for just breathing. You don't even need to be in the lesson!</p>
<h2>The Past</h2>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>With the new system, everybody is required to have a book to track merits and penalties (called a record book, but some teachers instead refer to them as "your book", "merit book", "record card", "<i>&lt;insert colour of book here&gt;</i> book", "penalty book" or "penalty point book" and possibly some others), if this is forgotten, a temporary book (never laminated and always a different colour to that of 'The Book' from the current term)is used just in case 'The Book' is required because if it is, and you don't have it on you, you (are supposed to) get an instant detention (though this is commonly not the case).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you lose your book you go to your Head of Year or your form tutor for a new one, and you get a penalty point. 'The Book' has two halves, the front half is merits, the back half is penalties. Unless you are a goody goody in every lesson, you are more likely to have the book signed in the back half. In the first term it was blue and in the second term it was green and laminated so it didn't fall apart. Then it was a vibrant yellow... whatever next? Well, we found out the answer.... another vivid blue! The books are always laminated without any names on the front and so you are supposed to write your name on, despite the fact it will have rubbed of within a few days.</p>
<h3>'The New Way Forward'? Apparently not...</h3>
<p>'Vivos' are used instead of merits, as staff saw that pupils did not have much interest in certificates. Vivos are usually meant to be given out in groups of five, but as is found, they are nearly always alone. Vivos are the equivalent of gift vouchers which can be spent in some shops or online. Teachers never mentioned the value of a vivo, but compared with prices are actually quite negligible (saving up from Year 7 to Year 11 wouldn't be enough for some products).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The record books are still issued as before, with merits (even though they were replaced) in the front and penalty points in the back. Teachers do not sign vivos in record books but assign them to students online. The vivo reward system does not apply to sixth formers, but neither do penalty points. Those who are in years 7 to 11 do get a card to pay using vivos and an internet account on www.vivomiles.com to keep track of their vivos. Parents can also make an account and follow their child(ren)'s progress.</p>
<h3>Ways to get Merit Points/Vivos</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Good work</li>
  <li>3 good homeworks...which means we will hardly get any merits now.</li>
  <li>Good test score</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commendations</h3>
<p>Usually you must gain 5 merits to achieve a commendation, but you must gain 10 merits to achieve a commendation in Year 10 and Year 11.</p>
<p>You would get a certificate for each commendation in assembly.&nbsp;</p>
