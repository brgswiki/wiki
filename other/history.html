<h2>BRGS: A History</h2>
<h3>A Quick Summary</h3>
<p>The book 'The History of BRGS' is particularly wordy and tends to drag on a lot, talking about how many shillings it cost to pay for a hymm book for a few pages etcetera. To save you the time, we have provided a summary and some highlights of the over 100 page book.</p>
<p>Most of BRGS' history is relatively boring and mostly includes talking about the change from coal to electric heaters and the school's problems with dry rot.</p>
<p>In the past, older students would get new students and either force them to sing in the lunch room or wrap them in a rug in Room 7 and then push them down the coal chute to the boiler house (this initiation ceremony was dubbed "throwing to the lions"). Dear Year 7s, please keep this in mind before trying to pick a fight with one of us older years &lt;3</p>

<p>Currently, in Year 7, your first few <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/subjects/geography">geography</a> and <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/subjects/history">history</a> lessons are spent looking for dates on drainpipes and the bomb shelter in school (after spending an hour looking for it, many students were not too impressed when <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/teachers/mr-vincent">Mr Vincent</a> in fact told us that there never has been one and it was just a joke question).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon further research, it turns out this was a double bluff and Mr Vincent had lied to us, twice! There is in fact actually a bomb shelter somewhere on school grounds (possible where the staff car park currently is?), and the basement corridor at some point was stocked with sandbags in preparation of an air raid.</p>
<h3>300 B.B. (Before BRGS)</h3>
<p>Towards the end of the 17th century, land was bequeathed by a certain John Kershaw to endow a school in the Waterfoot area of Rossendale for whatever reason. The school was eventually opened in 1701 and later moved to better premises across the valley in Newchurch, widely regarded as a bad move by the many students and staff memebrs who now have to walk up that hill at least once a day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The teachers of that school became the nucleus of the new staff at the Bacup and Rawtenstall Secondary and Technical School (later to change its name to Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School) which opened on the present site in 1913. The <a href="/other/headmasters">headmaster</a> of Newchurch Grammar School became the first head of the new school. Significantly (or not depending on how invested you are in the school's history), there have been only six headteachers since his retirement.</p>
<h3>1913 - It all begins…&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In these times of educational upheaval, reorganisation and re-reorganisation and threat of reorganisation, one can feel much sympathy with the Head, staff and pupils of the then well-established and prospering Newchurch Grammar School when, in September 1913, the time of uprooting came.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The County Architect, Mr. Henry Littler, had designed the new school, though not without difficulties. Back in the day getting planning permission was just as hard and getting a wider school hall would have a cost a bunch more money - students who have ever had to go through assemblies with their knees almost up to their ears because of lack of space will likely argue this would have been a worthy investment.</p>
<p>This new building provided, at first, a secondary school for three hundred and sixty-two boys and girls (<a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Alan</a>'s extensions since have boosted this number up to over a thousand higher), a small preparatory department, rooms for the evening classes of a Technical Institute and facilities for teaching such trades as weaving, spinning, boot and shoe manufacture and plumbing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who witnessed the opening of the school recall vividly the gleaming, fresh smelling woodwork, the desks as yet unscored by initial-carving penknives (or compasses/<a href="/other/whiteboard-pens">whiteboard</a> pens nowadays for particularly bored <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a> students), the leonine head of Mr. Jackson and the trim figure of Miss Niness; the hated black woollen stockings, gym lessons in the hall, with the climbing-ropes fixed in the lofty roof, and the thrill of walking round the <a href="/groups/places/balcony">balcony</a> (some may say this thrill hasn't gone away, one can easily find themselves wandering around it a couple of times at least).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Jackson, the headmaster at the time, wished to <s>understandably</s> retire but was forced to stay to make sure the move to the current site went smoothly. He in fact stayed until 1921, perhaps as a result of bribery, there aren't many reasons that could make one stay at BRGS that long.</p>
<p>In the first twelve months it increased in size from one hundred and eighty-eight to two hundred and nineteen pupils. Mr. Jackson confidently described it, at the first Speech Day, as "a secondary school... worthy to be compared with any school in Lancashire and perhaps outside that county... a lusty infant" having “all the promise of a vigorous youth and of strong and useful manhood.” which one may consider a bit of an unusual thing to say on a Speech Night but who knows, they olden days were strange times…</p>
<h3>The War Years: 1914-1918</h3>
<p>The local education authorities had acted just in time. Only twelve months after the school's "triumphant" inception came the first World War. The threat to civilians was much less at that time than it became during the second war, but the effects were nonetheless considerable. Unsure why this was considered considerable, yet BRGS' History states that a Mr. Harry Howard, of Bacup, who attended the school in 1916, comments: "The war had taken most of the male members of staff, replaced by, to our minds, very attractive ladies."</p>
<p>In this connection Mrs. E.M. Kershaw (nee Collinge) recalls Mr. Jackson at prayers, announcing casualties or promotions of those in the forces. She also remembers that wartime shortage of metal made it necessary, on Sports Day, to award certificates instead of the customary medals - what a tragedy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems highly probable that food shortages were partly responsible for the discontinuing of the lunches provided at Mr. Jackson's house. War-time recollections of lunch-time arrangements seem to centre largely on the bringing of various comestibles to school in the fibre "tommy-box", taking food to be heated, then going to claim one's own at lunch-time. Shortages there certainly were. Mrs. Bessie Ashworth mentions the use of swede turnips instead of potatoes, which were scarce, and wonders if anyone tried to make chips from them. Ground at the front of the school was dug over and vegetables grown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Leslie Stocks describes in his "History of John Maden &amp; Son Ltd.," which we have permission to quote: "I well remember the day when war ended on Monday 11th November 1918. 20 The school was on half-term holiday, but we were playing a house match... when all the mill hooters in the Valley were sounded to announce the end of hostilities. We completed the match but had some trouble getting home as the trains and trams had ceased to run, and everyone had decided to take a holiday. We went to school the following morning and were given the rest of the week as a holiday, most of which was spent collecting wood for a bonfire."</p>
