<h2>BRGS: A History</h2>
<h3>A Quick Summary</h3>
<p>The book 'The History of BRGS' is particularly wordy and tends to drag on a lot, talking about how many shillings it cost to pay for a hymm book for a few pages etcetera. To save you the time, we have provided a summary and some highlights of the over 100 page book.</p>
<p>Most of BRGS' history is relatively boring and mostly includes talking about the change from coal to electric heaters and the school's problems with dry rot.</p>
<p>In the past, older students would get new students and either force them to sing in the lunch room or wrap them in a rug in Room 7 and then push them down the coal chute to the boiler house (this initiation ceremony was dubbed "throwing to the lions"). Dear Year 7s, please keep this in mind before trying to pick a fight with one of us older years &lt;3</p>

<p>Currently, in Year 7, your first few <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/subjects/geography">geography</a> and <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/subjects/history">history</a> lessons are spent looking for dates on drainpipes and the bomb shelter in school (after spending an hour looking for it, many students were not too impressed when <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/teachers/mr-vincent">Mr Vincent</a> in fact told us that there never has been one and it was just a joke question). Upon further research, it turns out this was a double bluff and Mr Vincent had lied to us, twice! There is in fact actually a bomb shelter somewhere on school grounds (possible where the staff car park currently is?), and the basement corridor at some point was stocked with sandbags in preparation of an air raid.</p>
<h3>300 B.B. (Before BRGS)</h3>
<p>Towards the end of the 17th century, land was bequeathed by a certain John Kershaw to endow a school in the Waterfoot area of Rossendale for whatever reason. The school was eventually opened in 1701 and later moved to better premises across the valley in Newchurch, widely regarded as a bad move by the many students and staff memebrs who now have to walk up that hill at least once a day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The teachers of that school became the nucleus of the new staff at the Bacup and Rawtenstall Secondary and Technical School (later to change its name to Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School) which opened on the present site in 1913. The <a href="/other/headmasters">headmaster</a> of Newchurch Grammar School became the first head of the new school. Significantly (or not depending on how invested you are in the school's history), there have been only six headteachers since his retirement.</p>
<h3>1913-1920</h3>
<p>In these times of educational upheaval, reorganisation and re-reorganisation and threat of reorganisation, one can feel much sympathy with the Head, staff and pupils of the then well-established and prospering Newchurch Grammar School when, in September 1913, the time of uprooting came. The County Architect, Mr. Henry Littler, had designed the new school, though not without difficulties. Back in the day getting planning permission was just as hard and getting a wider school hall would have a cost a bunch more money - students who have ever had to go through assemblies with their knees almost up to their ears because of lack of space will likely argue this would have been a worthy investment.</p>
<p>This new building provided, at first, a secondary school for three hundred and sixty-two boys and girls (<a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Alan</a>'s extensions since have boosted this number up to over a thousand higher), a small preparatory department, rooms for the evening classes of a Technical Institute and facilities for teaching such trades as weaving, spinning, boot and shoe manufacture and plumbing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>____</p>
<p>"The ground floor contains four classrooms for thirty scholars each and eight for twenty-four scholars, grouped round a large central assembly hall; also rooms for headmaster, headmistress, assistant masters, assistant mistresses, a waiting room and a secretary's room adjoining the main entrance which is approached from a new street on the south side. "On the first floor there are three art rooms facing north, accommodating twenty-five, twenty-two and eighteen scholars respectively, a cookery and laundry-room for twenty-five, dining-room for forty, chemistry laboratories for twenty-five each, a lecture-room for fifty and a technical drawing-room for thirty. All these rooms open off a gallery which runs round the upper part of the central hall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Rooms for technical subjects are situated in the basement, which on the west side is above ground level. "The buildings are of stone faced externally with Yorkshire parpoints with ashlar dressings, and the roofs are covered with best quality Yorkshire slates. The assembly hall, entrances and classrooms have a tile dado, plastered above the same, while the rooms in the basement are faced internally with Accrington brick." It must be exceedingly difficult for those who have known the school only in the last decade or so to recognise it from the above description.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about those three northfacing art-rooms on the balcony? So far as we can gather, they never fulfilled their intended function, since we are told that art classes took place elsewhere. One of the early students, Mrs. Theobald, in a contribution to the 1963 "Squirrel" recalls that "Mr. Barker had to encourage our artistic skills in the fastnesses of Thistlemount. ..&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was incredible how often 'Mr. Barker kept us late, sir,' when mathematics or some equally objectionable subject followed and conversely, how often we had an irrefutable reason for being late at 16 Thistlemount, if we were no good at art." The astonishing fact that the new school had no gymnasium and no playingfields has already been mentioned as a great disappointment to the Newchurch Grammar School boys, who had enjoyed a well-equipped gymnasium at their old school. In the new building, the only facilities for physical education were ropes (in the assembly hall) and a vaulting-horse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the early years there was no P.E. mistress for the girls. Though segregated from the boys, they were nevertheless taught by the same Mr. Richardson who was responsible for boys' gymnastics. This state of affairs seems to have continued for the first ten years. As far as games were concerned, we are told in an article written for the 1963 "Squirrel" by the late Mr. C.S. Duthie: "There were no playing-fields. Some matches were played on the Newchurch school field, which was uneven, muddy and full of holes. At one time, games were played on a field somewhere at Cowpe, hockey at Edgeside, and Sports Day was held on the Rossendale United Football Field."</p>
<p>With all its advantages and disadvantages, and for all the pessimistic prognostication that it would be a "white elephant", the new school was formally opened on Saturday September 20th 1913 "in the presence of a large and distinguished assembly." The opener was the Chairman of Governors, Lieutenant-Colonel J. Craven Hoyle, whose name has been known to generations of B.R.G.S. pupils from the House Shields, still occasionally referred to as the "Craven Hoyle Shields". A brief mention may here be made of the Rouse system which prevailed for about the first twenty years of the school's existence. Pupils were divided into three houses only, according to the district where they lived: Bacup, Waterfoot and Rawtenstall, the boundary lines being Cloughfold and Stacksteads Stations. The disadvantages which led to a change of system will be dealt with in a later chapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It must have softened the blow considerably for the boys of Newchurch Grammar School 'that their Headmaster and several staff were uprooted and transplanted with them. Similarly, the head and assistants from the Pupil-Teachers' Centre were also appointed to the new school. All these ladies and gentlemen, along with others newlyappointed, were present at the grand opening ceremony. Pupils, however, it is pointed out, were not represented at the official opening, and had to wait until a week later to sample the atmosphere of their new school. Mrs. Martha Heath (nee Thomas) writing for the 1973 "Anthology", gives her impressions: "Sixty years ago our new school opened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recall vividly the gleaming, freshsmelling woodwork, the desks as yet unscored by initial-carving penknives, the leonine head of Mr. Jackson and the trim figure of Miss Niness; our hated black woollen stockings, gym. lessons in the hall, with the climbing-ropes fixed in the lofty roof, and the thrill of walking round the balcony." In the 1963 magazine, the late Mrs. E.J. Ingham (nee Pickup) who came from the Pupil-Teacher Centre, records her recollections: "After the midsummer holidays the change took effect. There were members of staff and pupils from the two schools, several 17 new teachers, and some boys and girls drawn from various sources." "The changes," Dr. M.B. Ormerod informs us, "were carried out as painlessly as possible. They must, however, have caused distress to Mr. Jackson. . . He wished to retire, but was urged to accept the headship of the new school to ensure a smooth start. The existing staff of Newchurch Grammar School - Mr. Tonkinson, Mr. Owen, Mr. Anstey and Mr. Richardson was appointed to the staff of the new school. . .&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ladies who had run the Pupil-Teacher Centre, Miss Niness, Miss Wrigley and Miss Lord were also appointed, Miss Niness as senior mistress." Of these early teachers and many who followed in their footsteps, more will be said later. Suffice it now to say that Mr. T.E. Jackson, who had been prevailed upon to ease the transition to the new school, did in fact remain as its Headmaster until 1921. He was succeeded then by Mr. E.H. Holden, who had been appointed in 1913 as Head of the Evening School and teacher of chemistry in the day school. Just as Newchurch Grammar School had flourished under Mr. Jackson's aegis, so the new secondary school was successfully launched. In the first twelve months it increased in size from one hundred and eighty-eight to two hundred and nineteen pupils. Mr. Jackson confidently described it, at the first Speech Day, as "a secondary school... worthy to be compared with any school in Lancashire and perhaps outside that county... a lusty infant" having "all the promise of a vigorous youth and of strong and useful manhood.</p>
