<p>BRGS has achieved the status of <i>the ultimate</i> job for any headmaster, illustrated by the fact that there have only ever been 7 headmasters since 1913.</p>
<h3><strong>Mr Jackson</strong></h3>

<p>Oversaw the move from Newchurch Grammar School to the newly constructed hilltop BRGS in 1913 and was head until 1921, despite wanting to retire earlier. Mr Thomas Earnest Jackson was Kent-born and attended Cambridge Uni, having taught in 3 schools before becoming headmaster of Newchurch in his mid thirties.</p>
<h3><strong>Mr Holden</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Edmund Haworth Holden was a chemistry teacher who took the reins of power in 1921 and continued as head for 27 years, until 1948, having to lead BRGS through the war years. He went to Manchester Uni and was a northern man. He was very strict on segregation and even the stairs to the <a href="/groups/places/balcony">balcony</a> were ‘girls’ stairs' and ‘boys’ stairs'</p>
<h3><strong>Mr Copley</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Copley led the school for a further 20 years. He was first a Senior Language Master at BRGS from 1938, but had been in the Royal Air Force during the second World War for 5 years. He retired in 1969.</p>
<h3><strong>Phillip Clark</strong></h3>

</figure>
<p>Taking over in 1969, Clark now has his own building dedicated to the sixth form and library. He was from the Midlands and had taught in Yorkshire before, clearly his standards had lowered when he moved here. He didn't have a car and got to school via bus. Unlike all the previous headmasters, he was unknown to the school before he became headmaster. Mr Clark also taught all first year students RS and as a result seemed to know every pupil personally.</p>

<h3><strong>Martyn Morris OBE</strong></h3>
<p>Mr Morris OBE did a lot of behind-the-scenes work for BRGS, providing a large astroturf place for sports lessons. As his final legacy, construction of the new sports hall began around the time of his retirement. Mr Morris was well liked by all students, shown by the massive celebrations as his headship came to an end. He also had a lot of wall clocks in his office.</p>
<p>Notably, Morris received an OBE for his services to education under John Major's government.</p>
<h3><strong>Marc Morris</strong></h3>
<p>Mr Morris II was the next headmaster at BRGS, taking over the school in mid-2005. He had overseen a healthy eating campaign, and was present for the final stages of the construction of the New Sports Hall and the Super Common Room. Lord Morris likes Harry Potter. He also organised the construction of the new English Block, before departing to become head of Sha Tin college in Hong Kong.</p>

<h3><strong>Mr Porteous</strong></h3>
<p><a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a> successfully beat the competition for the "coveted" role of headmaster and arrived in 2012. He is most known for his construction of corridors and extensions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many will also not forget the Christmas Assembly where Mr Porteous adorned some Christmas tree sunglasses, a black Santa hat, and a bright orange plastic saxophone!&nbsp;</p>
