<h2>2017 Sports Day</h2>
<p>Can't remember much about this fateful day apart from many containers were filled with astroturf to pass the time. This was still in the days of form pride when students would make posters to cheer on their fellow form members - now the form spirit has withered and died, and a now only a half hearted applause occurs each race or so.</p>
