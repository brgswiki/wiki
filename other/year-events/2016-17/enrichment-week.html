<h2>Enrichment Week 2017</h2>
<p>This was the last ever classic Enrichment Week before BRGS decided to just label education as fun and change the next Enrichment Week to being STEM based etc. Some of the traditional events this year included jewellery making with <a href="/teachers/past/mr-fitton">Mr Fitton</a>, mock trial, making a video (from the following themes - Celebrity Wedding, Living on Marsâ€¦ yadda yadda), and a typical sports day that involved sack races, piggybacks, egg &amp; spoon, and a wheelbarrow race with <a href="/teachers/mrs-stevenson-jones">Mrs Stevenson-Jones</a> <s>screaming</s> chanting your team name at you whilst you're in second to last with no hope of winning.</p>
