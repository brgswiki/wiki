<h2>Halloween Disco</h2>

<p>One of the last Halloween discos to be held, and welcomed the current <a href="/students/intake16">Year 11</a> into a taster of BRGS Events. Of course, it couldn't be a proper BRGS event without the staff's stormtrooper dance which can be seen <a href="https://youtu.be/HB-cnX10kn4">here</a> (if you manage to recognise your own Year 7 voice - apologies!)</p>
<p>As no one really knew anyone, the main party was in each form room, where each person would sit in their form room chatting and eating crisps whilst <a href="/teachers/mrs-bowdler">Mrs Bowdler</a> enthusiastically tried and failed to get everyone on the dance floor - herself probably having done the most dancing that day out of the whole year.</p>
<p>Each form had their own dress up theme, <a href="/students/intake16/s">S</a> - things beginning with S, <a href="/students/intake16/n">N</a> - the undead, <a href="/students/intake16/w">W</a> - pyjamas etc.</p>
