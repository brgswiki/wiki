<h2>2017 Paris</h2>
<p>Absolutely boiling, between us all probably downed the same volume of water as the River Siene.</p>
<h3>Memories</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“Mr Reeves passing out on the coach.”</li>
  <li>Everybody cheering each time we went under a bridge, much to <a href="/teachers/miss-ingham">Miss Ingham</a>'s dismay</li>
  <li>The fake bomb threat :')</li>
  <li>“Climbing out of the window of the hotel room only for <a href="/teachers/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a> to walk in.”</li>
</ul>
