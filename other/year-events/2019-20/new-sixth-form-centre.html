<h2>Transformed Sixth Form Centre</h2>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:22.38%;"><img src="/other/sixth_form_centre.png"></figure>
<p>The Sixth Form Centre got a revamp with a new grey/blue colour scheme and new chairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many students may argue that they didn't really want a redesigned sixth form centre and rather improved support or educational facilities but instead were given the former which became the theme of many <a href="/other/meme-pages">memes</a> and was said by many to look like a hospital.</p>
<p>The BRGS Website's (more enthusiastic) article on it can be found <a href="https://www.brgs.org.uk/news/2019-09-23-brgs-sixth-form-centre-transformed">here</a>.</p>
