<h2>Quiz Night 2019</h2>
<p>A fun evening of wooden spoons, running around the balcony, and Paw Patrol question themed questions. The Quizmaster was also none other than <a href="/teachers/past/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a> himself, occasionally exclaiming “You've won a bottle o' beer!”, “Cars… not quite sure what that is.”, and the ever-classic “It's the taking part that counts.”</p>
<p>The teams are mostly made up of students'/staffs' families and alumni, rarely attracting teams made fully up of only students or staff themselves.</p>
