<h2>Falmouth Art Gallery 2020</h2>
<p>7 Year 12 art students went to Falmouth Art Gallery to display their work. The weeks leading up to this event were filled with Mrs Bamford talking about various methods of transportation from car to plane on how to get to Cornwall and showing her classes lots of pictures of some artist called Vinnie James' work.</p>
