<h2>Yorkshire Dales</h2>
<p>Bit damp, bit cold, quite foggy. Saw some rocks, saw some sheep, ate some crisps. Came back.</p>
<h3>The Story Begins (Part 1)</h3>
<p>First off, you come to school wearing normal clothes, then depart on a magical journey over many various A-roads to eventually come to the village of Clapham. Two teams split up, one going into White Scar Caves, the other venturing off into the wild countryside. In the caves, be sure to bash your head a few times just to get used to it - you will do that a lot and see many strangely shaped limestone features. Apparently it is always a joy to hear from our school when <a href="/teachers/mr-spencer">Mr Spencer</a> does the annual booking.</p>
<h3>Limestone Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Devils Tongue - apparently will give you bad luck if it drips on you... "I caught some in my mouth and my luck improved, try it!"</li>
  <li>Damocles' Sword - a rather sharp looking stalagmite that got broken by 'some young punks'.</li>
  <li>Judges head - a tiny little limestone head the looks like one of those judges with a wig on.</li>
  <li>On the shelf-like structure holding "The Judges Head", there is also something that does look quite rude and intimidating to men there - don't ask.</li>
</ul>
