<h2>Enrichment Week 2018</h2>
<p>Ah… The first of many education based Enrichment Weeks. Students who have never gone through one of these you haven't missed out. The week roughly went along the lines of: (May be different for Year 7s at the time)</p>
<h3>Monday</h3>
<p>The lowkey racist Refugee Day, where students had to play a game not dissimilar to Monopoly but where you collected water instead. In the afternoon, resources were better and you had to go though websites with stories from refugees and so on.</p>
<h3>Tuesday</h3>
<p>The infamous STEM day which had activities such as:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Making a pulley across the length of the <a href="/groups/places/balcony">balcony</a> to try and get as many tomatoes over as possible. At first this was just only about 17 tomatoes, but by the end of the day students had upgraded to using a whole net to carry multiple packets of tomatoes.</li>
  <li>“Flash and bang show” which was mostly <a href="/teachers/mrs-stevenson-jones">Mrs Stevenson-Jones</a> using the science department's chemicals in a bunch of cool practicals whilst students gasped and murmured ‘<i>witchcraft</i>’</li>
  <li>Code breaking with <a href="/teachers/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a> only to discover the codes all just revealed <a href="/teachers/miss-hartley">Miss Hartley</a> level jokes and famous movie lines, leaving the whole group seeking revenge on <a href="/teachers/mr-seddon">Mr Seddon</a>.</li>
  <li>Catapult building with <a href="/teachers/past/mr-fitton">Mr Fitton</a> out of lollipop sticks and play-dough to knock over plastic cups whilst he yelled at us for not being serious enough and not building them properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wednesday</h3>
<p>The day when everybody goes on a trip, either Blackpool or Activity Day. Those who stayed at BRGS had to learn about plastic pollution.</p>
<h3>Thursday</h3>
<p>This day comprised of the ever fun junk band. The songs &amp; prizes of the following forms (now <a href="/students/intake16">year 11</a>) include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/students/intake16/b">16B</a> - YMCA, best form performance</li>
  <li><a href="/students/intake16/s">16S</a> - Believer, most creative instruments - to which we must credit Mr Bretherton who told us to just “stick anything onto a box” and pretend it did something to make it look interesting.</li>
  <li><a href="/students/intake16/n">16N</a> - The Greatest Show, featuring <i>someone</i> in a cardboard box spinning around</li>
  <li><a href="/students/intake16/w">16W</a> - Forgot the song, but it involved the same cardboard box being filled with handmade confetti, upon being told they would have to tidy it all up if they released it from the balcony they compromised and only decided to throw a few handfuls. Unfortunately, whilst bringing it down at the end of the performance they dropped it anyway. Bits of cut out coloured paper was found in the hall for weeks</li>
  <li><a href="/students/intake16/r">16R</a> -</li>
  <li><a href="/students/intake16/g">16G</a> -</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
