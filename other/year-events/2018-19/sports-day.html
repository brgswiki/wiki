<h2>Sports Day 2019</h2>
<p>After being postponed many times as a result of the temperamental Rossendale weather, Sports Day was eventually split into a separate event for each year group. No one really knows why they did this, perhaps so students would spend more in time lesson rather than watching other year groups running around for 2 hours, but that seems a little farfetched.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sports Day (the actual event) ended up coinciding with Open Evening, meaning many students were showing around parents and prospective students in trainers - much to <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a>' dismay.</p>
