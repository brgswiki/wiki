<h2>Coursework</h2>
<p>An AWFUL, TERRIBLE torture method set up by the government to punish innocent GCSE students, making us work EVEN HARDER. However, if is effective if you do not perform greatly in exams, as it can boost your grade up.</p>
<p>The main subjects for coursework are art and DT. In art your portfolio/coursework makes up 60% of your grade (unfortunately the over 40% is made up of a 10 hour exam), and DT involves making a number of A3 pages full of writing about what colours a family member likes for 50% of your grade.</p>
