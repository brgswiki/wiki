## About the Meme Pages
As of 2020 there are three relevant pages regarding BRGS Meme Pages. they consist of BRGSsixthformemes, BRGSmemes and BRGSmemes123. The owners are usually anonymous to avoid any issues with teachers and students. Often, they are ran by at least one student in Year 13 although sometimes they have two owners. Towards the end of the owners' final year in Sixth Form, they run a competition of their own choosing to pick their successor. This is usually a meme making competition. 

### Staff recognition

Although initially they were secretive, most teachers appear to be aware of the pages now, with even Mr Reeves making reference to them in an assembly, and the 2020 Christmas assembly, which was streamed over Google Meet to the whole school with a framerate of two, included the advent calandars from the BRGSmemes123 page and a whole TikTok segment.

I'm not supposed to give my opinion, but I think these meme pages hold too much power over the school, and also they distract the teachers and cause them to create an endless stream of TikToks. (Not a bad thing per se...)

Some teachers even follow these meme pages, so shout out to these utter legends!

Sixth form teacher Mrs Berry was shown a meme about Mr Morriss and made the class promise not to tell that she had laughed at it.

## BRGSsixthformmemes
BRGSSixthformmemes was the first meme page to be created by a BRGS student. It was created on the 14th March 2019 by Year 13 Nathan Scheider. The first meme posted to the account consists of an image of a blue and red pill labelled "Accepting that students can still learn no matter what they wear" and "yelling at students for wearing trainers" respectively. This is then followed by a hand labelled BRGS Sixth Form reaching into a pile of red pills.

The account was taken over by Lewis Barron in Late 2019.
The account currently has 1,007 followers as of 28/12/2020.

## BRGSmemes
BRGSmemes was the second account to be made, on the 13th May 2019 posting a meme depicting a scene from Avengers Endgame where Thanos about to punch a character. It was captioned "Nobody: Not a Single Soul: Mr Seddon on a Monday period 1 maths lesson:"

The account currently has 1,010 followers as of 28/12/2020.

## BRGSmemes123
BRGSmemes123 was the last of the three main memepages and was be created on the 23rd September 2019, with a single photo of Mr Reeves in a red school uniform captioned "When you're in yr 7 and your mum gets you to put on your new uniform for a photo".

This is the account most teachers mean when they refer to the 'meme pages' as it was the most active over lockdown and uses almost entirely staff memes.

This account is credited with creating the new BRGS Wiki.
As of 28/12/2020 it has 858 followers.
