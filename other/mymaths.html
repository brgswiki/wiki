<h2>MyMaths</h2>
<p>This is a website often used by maths teachers as a lifesaver for them for setting <a href="/other/homework">homework</a>. However, from the students' point of view it is the bane of our existence as each time there are different questions so you can't copy off someone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You used to be able to just type in the link at the top of the page that would give you 100% but this no longer works to many students' dismay. A good excuse for not doing the homework is just “oh I must have forgotten to press the checkout button” as your work doesn't save unless you have pressed this.</p>
