<h2>Exam Invigilators</h2>
<p>Any of those lucky enough to have sat exams or mocks in the sports hall will have had experienced the blessed presence of the exam invigilators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often they seem familiar in some way but you cannot place them…</p>
<p>Some have also seen the <a href="/other/meme-pages">meme pages</a> and have allegedly found the most recent mock season memes funny.</p>
<h3>Noteworthy Invigilators</h3>
<p>Students distinguish between them in many ways, mostly “the one who always wears that funky scarf” or “that guy who always wears shorts” or more simply, “Mr Garlick” (this is indeed his name, although no one really knows which one is Mr Garlick as they all look so similar…)</p>
<p>One of the invigilators is also <a href="/teachers/miss-morris">Miss Morris</a>' fiance, another was an old primary school headteacher and would walk past and say ‘hello (student), how are you?’ to her ex-pupils just as the exams were about to start.</p>
