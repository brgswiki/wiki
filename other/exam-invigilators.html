<h2>Exam Invigilators</h2>
<p>Any of those lucky enough to have sat exams or mocks in the sports hall will have had experienced the blessed presence of the exam invigilators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often they seem familiar in some way but you cannot place them…</p>
<p>Some have also seen the <a href="/other/meme-pages">meme pages</a> and have allegedly found the most recent mock season memes funny.</p>
<h3>Noteworthy Invigilators</h3>
<p>Students distinguish between them in many ways, mostly “the one who always wears that funky scarf” or “that guy who always wears shorts” or more simply, “Mr Garlick” (this is indeed his name, although no one really knows which one is Mr Garlick as they all look so similar…)</p>
<p>One of the invigilators is also <a href="/teachers/miss-morris">Miss Morris</a>' fiance, another was an old primary school headteacher and would walk past and say ‘hello (student), how are you?’ to her ex-pupils just as the exams were about to start.</p>
<p>One particular invigilator during the 2021 assessments (the scuffed GCSE year) seemed to spend all their time, slowly drawing the exam start and finish time in bubble writing on the whiteboards - this was partially inconvinent as the concept of time in the massive expanse of the sport hall was easily lost and it was important to manage your remaining minutes. But I guess having a nice bubble written time is also aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<h3>Fond Memories&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/teachers/mr-seddon">Mr Seddon</a> violently slashing water bottle wrappers off</li>
  <li>Mr Seddon violently removing calculator lids</li>
  <li>Mr Seddon</li>
  <li>The one invigilator changing the sequence of rows which can go each time</li>
  <li>The same invigilator telling row ‘J’ they can go then wondering why no one was leaving when this row does not in fact exist</li>
  <li>The invigilator again going in backwards alphabetical order but for some reason leaving out ‘G’ and just didn't come back to them until everyone else had gone</li>
  <li>The invigilators opening the doors for ventilation purposes but only to find a bird had seized this opportunity to join in the exam fun</li>
  <li>Mr Davenport voicing all the words pre-exam &lt;3 That man should become a voice actor</li>
</ul>
