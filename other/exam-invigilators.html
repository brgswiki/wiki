<h2>Exam Invigilators</h2>
<p>Any of those lucky enough to have sat exams or mocks in the sports hall will have had experienced the blessed presence of the exam invigilators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often they seem familiar in some way but you cannot place them…</p>
<p>Some have also seen the <a href="/other/meme-pages">meme pages</a> and have allegedly found the most recent mock season memes funny.</p>
<h3>Noteworthy Invigilators</h3>
<p>Students distinguish between them in many ways, mostly “the one who always wears that funky scarf” or “that guy who always wears shorts” or more simply, “Mr Garlick” (this is indeed his name, although no one really knows which one is Mr Garlick as they all look so similar…)</p>
<p>One of the invigilators is also <a href="/teachers/miss-morris">Miss Morris</a>' fiance, another was an old primary school headteacher and would walk past and say ‘hello (student), how are you?’ to her ex-pupils just as the exams were about to start.</p>
<p>One particular invigilator during the 2021 assessments (the scuffed GCSE year) seemed to spend all their time, slowly drawing the exam start and finish time in bubble writing on the whiteboards - this was partially inconvinent as the concept of time in the massive expanse of the sport hall was easily lost and it was important to manage your remaining minutes. But I guess having a nice bubble written time is also aesthetically pleasing.</p>
