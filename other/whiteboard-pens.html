<h2>Whiteboard Pens</h2>
<p>Probably the single most stolen item of all <a href="/groups/places/brgs">BRGS</a>. But they have so many uses other than just writing valuable teaching information, such as...</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drawing hilarious caricatures of teachers</li>
  <li>Writing or drawing on the board before the teacher comes in</li>
  <li>Writing useful information such as ‘maths is boring’ underneath desks</li>
  <li>Writing time-based information, such as countdowns to school breakups for summer, Easter, Christmas and half term holidays</li>
  <li>Drawing things on peoples' faces</li>
  <li>Placing in high up places in <a href="/groups/rooms/science/5">Room 5</a></li>
  <li>Throwing at people</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard whiteboard marker has been superseded by the far greater Interactive whiteboard marker. These are not stolen items as they are guarded like gold by all teachers, especially the maths department. <a href="/teachers/mrs-chapman">Mrs Chapman</a> is known to have at least 10 of these ultimate teaching pens, most teachers only have two.</p>
<p><a href="/teachers/mrs-stevenson-jones">Mrs Stevenson-Jones</a> <i>had </i>a lot of whiteboard pens, but they can now only be found on… ledges, Room 5's projector, the top shelves of the beaker cupboards, on top of the whiteboard itself etc.</p>
