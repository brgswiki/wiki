<h2>Protest 1961</h2>
<p>A Daily Mail newspaper article from <a href="/other/history">4th March 1961</a> states the following:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Upper Fifth End Angry Silence</h2>
<p>A committee of boys of the Upper Fifth met in a specially allocated classroom a few yards from the <a href="/other/headmasters">headmaster</a>'s <a href="/groups/rooms/office/19">study</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>And after a ten-minute meeting they voted to end the “angry silence” that spread through the school over the past two days.</p>
<p>The boys of Bacup and Rawtenstall, Lancashire, Grammar School started their “silence” - a ban on the singing of the assembly hymn - in protest against the withdrawal of privileges after five 1s. 8d. electric bulbs were smashed.</p>
<p>But yesterday they decided to end the silence after 16-year-old Ian Rayner had told them: “The Head is right. I think we should accept his terms and call it off.”</p>
<h3>The Verdict</h3>
<p>A few minutes later, greying Mr William Copley, who has been 22 years at the school on the edge of the moors, was invited to the meeting.</p>
<p>He head the verdict. Then told them: “The privilege of freedom of movement in school will be restored from Monday.”</p>
<p>The trouble started early this week when the bulbs were taken from the basement cloakroom and broken. Mr Copley started inquiries to find the culprit.</p>
<p>He did not succeed. So he withdrew the privilege of freedom of use of the school buildings.</p>
<p>Ian Rayner told me: “Mr Copley narrowed it down to the Upper Fifth C and D. We had a meeting in the playground on Wednesday, and I suggested that I would not sing at assembly and the others said they would follow suit. It spread a but after that. When the time came round to sing the hymn we just kept silent. It was the same this morning. Then a deputation talked with Mr Copley and he said he would be satisfied if we accepted collective responsibility and paid for the bulbs.”</p>
<h3>Special Room</h3>
<p>“We have been thinking it over and we think he is right. In fact, I would have done just the same thing if I had been in his position.”</p>
<p>Some of the boys also refused to answer masters' questions, and one class for a time kept their hands on their heads.</p>
<p>A few minutes after he had left the meeting of the Upper Fifth in a classroom a few yards away from his study - which he had allocated for the deliberations - Mr Copley told me: “I prefer to let the boys work out such things for themselves. I believe in giving them as much responsibility as possible.”</p>
<p>“The breaking of the bulbs was a breach of that responsibility and therefore, it was punished accordingly.”</p>
<p>But like most angry demonstrations, there were those taking part who did not quite know what the facts were. A small boy from the second form told me: “I joined in because someone said the withdrawal of privileges included games and physical education. I like P.E.”</p>
