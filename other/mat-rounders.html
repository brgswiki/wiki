<h2>Mat Rounders</h2>
<p>Many a student who has ever attended a <a href="/subjects/pe">PE</a> lesson will be scarred from the number of hours they have had to endure playing this game. At first, younger students may not appreciate this great game wishing to do something else for once, but as you get older you begin to realise how great it is having to so little effort in PE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can literally get away with doing next to nothing most mat rounders games as the PE teachers just sit on the benches chatting or watching YouTube on their (school issued) iPads.</p>
<p>Mat rounders makes up approximately 96% of your PE lessons so you may as well make the most of it. You can also just switch teams however often you want to just sit out with friends and chat at the benches at the back of the Sports Hall.</p>
