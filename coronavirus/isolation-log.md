### Memories
> "Our class was on Google Meet all day, playing Among Us all day and giving each other the answers to the quizzes they gave us :)"

> "The teachers actually expect us to take the full hour to do the work, but in reality, we've finished after 15 minutes"

> "We all were talking on the WhatsApp group chat and giving each other the answers so no one had to do the full day's work."
