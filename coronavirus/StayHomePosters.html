<h2>A Brilliant Idea</h2>
<p>During the beginning of lockdown, in March 2020, Mr Reeves posted a brilliant idea on the "BRGS News" Google Classroom: designing lockdown posters. Now we all know that this was a vital chance to show your image editing skills, but more importantly - how many memes you can fit into one poster.</p>

<h3>Some posters</h3>
<p>I'm now going to proceed to rate these posters, based on several factors such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is it not an eyesore?</li>
  <li>How much colour does it have?</li>
  <li>How many memes does it have?</li>
  <li>How good are the memes?</li>
  <li>Does it convince me to stay inside?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Big Chungus Poster</h3>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:18.49%;"><img src="/lockdownposter1.png" alt="Public servic anouncment - this little piggy went to the market (sick pig), this little piggy stayed at home (man with ugly pig mask thumbs upping), big chungus says don't be an stupid STAY SAFE STAY HOME STAY COOL, NHS text in bottom right">
  <figcaption>Stay SAFE, stay HOME, stay COOL</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The poster conveys a strong strong sense of commandment, and clearly demonstrates how going outside will result in your immediate illness. It gives me the urge to become the piggy on the right, and become that happy and handsome in my life. Additionally, the iconic figure of big chungus and it's insane authority will convince you to stay home, and it's insults will surely convince the rest of the British public to also stay home. Also the NHS “logo” in the bottom right asserts the fact that this is an official and legit poster that should be taken seriously.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not an eyesore - 7/10</li>
  <li>Colour - 6/10</li>
  <li>Memes quantity - 8/10</li>
  <li>Meme quality - 7/10</li>
  <li>Meaning - 9/10</li>
  <li>Overall - 7.5/10</li>
</ul>
