####  Some teachers have told funny stories about themselves in lessons but the stories aren’t related to BRGS. Should this be left out as it isn’t fully relevant to BRGS?
Stories or anecdotes can still be added, as long as the teacher or staff member has *told* you/the class the story, otherwise it could be deemed a breach of privacy.
