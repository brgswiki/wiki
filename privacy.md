EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework:

BRGS Wiki complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States and has certified its compliance with it.

With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, BRGS Wiki is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. FTC.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
