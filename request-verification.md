Thank you for creating an account on the *BRGS Wiki*!
Before we get you editing, please make sure that:
- Your account does **NOT** use your real name (we [care about your privacy](/privacy)).
- You have entered and verified a valid email address with your account.
- Your account's email is **NOT** a brgsmail.org.uk address (this could potentially be traced).
- Your username isn't offensive/inappropriate, or too similar to a moderator's username (Le Admin, BRGSmemes123, and Moderator 123).

All good? Excellent. To get verified as a Wiki editor, just comment `'Verify me'` in the comments section below and we will get back to you ASAP to get your account up and running properly. Once verified, your comment will be deleted.
