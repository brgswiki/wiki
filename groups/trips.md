# School Trips
BRGS hosts a number of school trips, particularly for the lower years. Some of these trips do indeed include hotels although many include staying in a tent in -6Â°C  being dragged through the muddy back end of nowhere with [Chappers](/teachers/mrs-chapman) getting annoyed at everyone. Most school trips have awful food, so bring as much of your own if you can - you have been warned. However, over the years BRGS seems to be cutting down on some trips, possibly to spare some extra cash for [Alan's](/teachers/mr-porteous) corridor addiction, although of course we don't know for sure.
