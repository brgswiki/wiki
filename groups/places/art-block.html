<h2>Art Block</h2>
<p>Originally built in 1996 (as every good <a href="/students/intake20">Year 7</a> knows from having to look at the drains), the art department encompasses Room A01, A02, and A102. The <a href="/subjects/music">music</a> room is also technically in this building but the art department refuse to acknowledge this and have been known to just walk through music lessons as if it were a corridor, singing along to whatever students are playing and eating sandwiches.</p>
<p>The middle room on the ground floor is now art teachers secret hangout where they store masses of Kenco instant coffee and a stash of digestives. The art teachers are often seen popping into this room during a lesson (probably to eat more biscuits and look at the stolen pupils artwork hidden in one of the many cupboards).</p>
<p>This small middle room is also known as "The Batcave" or the "Art block's perineum". This hallowed space between rooms A01 and A02 is where <a href="/teachers/miss-flint">Miss Flint</a>, <a href="/teachers/miss-watts">Miss Watts</a> and <a href="/teachers/mrs-bamford">Mrs Bamford</a> may retire to enjoy a glass of wine, microwaveable meal or spot of ironing.</p>
<p>It is considered a great privilege to enter this room, the minimum requirement usually being the study of <a href="/subjects/art">Art</a> at A Level, or a decently priced bottle of wine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also a storage room upstairs in Room A102. This room is also used to store a multitude of art-related books, materials and projects. Other contents of the middle room include a box labeled "assorted bones", a few red Nescafe mugs, a plastic skeleton or two, a small collection of irons and an ironing board.&nbsp;</p>
