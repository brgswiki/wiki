<h2>Room 64</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/estate-office-small.png"></figure>
<p>Room 64, or also known as the Estate Office, is a little seen room by students. &nbsp;All that has been seen in here is the 'noo noo' pipe type things, plastic chairs (possibly even older than those in the languages classrooms), and some traffic cones.</p>
<h3>MI6</h3>
<p>It is mostly used by technicians and the welfare staff as a secret hideout. As many students have never set foot in this room it was debated that it was used as a rural MI6 site.</p>
<p>Our suspicions were confirmed when we checked the map and floorplan of BRGS (on the right) and there is in fact a little label saying 'tunnel access', most likely allowing the agents disguised as welfare staff to travel between BRGS and their headquarters back in London with ease.</p>
