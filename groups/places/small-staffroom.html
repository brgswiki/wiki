<p>This room goes by many names, currently the ‘Sheep in a Jeep’ staffroom, although in the past it has been known as the ‘Dragon in a Wagon’, ‘Rabbit in a Habit’ (or the ‘nunny’), and the ‘Pig in a Wig’. <a href="/teachers/miss-jackson">Miss Jackson</a> apparently organises this sign each year although the past two years have stuck as Sheep in a Jeep.</p>

<p>Not many have seen the inside of this room, as beyond the door all you can see is boxes with various labels such as ‘babies’ or ‘condoms’ leading many younger students to wonder what exactly does happen in the staffroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever a member of staff answers the door they'll be sure to only open it a smidge to defend whatever remains inside this room, meaning you can only see one eye as they look out through the crack of the door whilst you try to convey to them why you haven't done the <a href="/other/homework">homework</a>.</p>

<p>Not much is known about what is in this room, as there aren't even any windows. All one can tell you about it is from guesswork and staff hearsay. The smaller one is generally regarded as the nicer one and seems to be where all the <a href="/subjects/science">science</a> teachers hang out when they are not drinking tea and discussing subatomic particles on the <a href="/groups/places/balcony">balcony</a>.</p>
