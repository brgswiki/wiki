<h2>The Balcony</h2>
<p>The balcony overlooks the main hall and houses all the <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a> and <a href="/subjects/biology">biology</a> labs, one <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> room, two Head of Year offices, and a number of lab technician &amp; storage rooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technically, you are not supposed to go here during lunch but this rule has become less and less enforced over the past few years and therefore is no longer really in place. The balcony is generally regarded as having some of the best views in school, as during events taking place in the main hall you can just watch from above and during particularly boring science lessons the windows provide a lovely view of Waterfoot and surrounding hills.</p>
<h3>Advice</h3>
<p>Be careful when wandering around the balcony, a rogue lab technician may run you over with their trolley.</p>
<p>If you have a science lesson after a break and your science teacher is yet to turn up (the majority of them aren't the most punctual), try and see how many times you can walk around the balcony before they turn up. The record is currently 14 times - although on this particular attempt the participants walked past <a href="/teachers/supply/mrs-saunders">Mrs Saunders</a> at least 5 times, each time she was more and more confused and was quoted to have said "Here again??" and "Not you lot again! Don't you have lessons to go to?"</p>
