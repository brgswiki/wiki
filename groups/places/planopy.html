<h2>The Canopy</h2>
<p>The canopy is a glass plated building located between the <a href="/groups/places/art-block">art block</a> and the sixth form centre that relates to a massive human greenhouse. It is used for a Year 10 and 11 dining area, and for year assemblies. It has a lot of very big and very long tables with little round things which are apparently stools (no, they couldn't even treat us to chairs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the summer (when, on those rare occasions, we are blessed with sunlight), it gets <strong>very </strong>warm, and in winter, it gets very cold. To fix the latter problem (they probably worked out we get more cold than warm in Rossendale) they installed some heaters which hand down from the roof - it's hard to sit underneath them without wondering what would happen if one fell on you.</p>
