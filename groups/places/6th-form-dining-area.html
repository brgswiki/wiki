<h2>6th Form Common Room</h2>
<p>There are mixed feelings about the 6th Form Common Room, a place out of bounds for lower school students and therefore the step up to sixth form is mostly about the anticipation of seeing the common room. Unfortunately, other than the pool tables, the common room has now been given a very hospital look. The following are all snippets from an old Squirrel magazine on students' opinions of the common room when it was newly built.</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>Near the top at the main slope, somewhere in the region of Waterfoot. Smallish, comparable to the Club Royale but much better.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Shape</h3>
<p>Sort of rectangular.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>People</h3>
<p>There are students from all over the Rossendale Valley, from areas as obscure as Whitworth right to the other side of Haslingden. (Is there civilisation on the other side of Haslingden?) Socialising is made easy by the many diverse personalities, with interests ranging from beer, to studying (Yes, some do it for fun!!) to running around a lot! This is one extreme to the other, but what's a common room without extremity?!&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reviews</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The 6th form has a "hard-working, but relaxed atmosphere." (anon); a place to make some good friends. You would have to go a long way before finding another such "community".&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>The teachers respect us for who we are and we get chance to voice our own opinions through the above mentioned 6th form committee. This openness is also shared with "warm, caring, generous tutors" (very much anon).&nbsp;</p>
