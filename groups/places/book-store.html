<h2>English Book Store</h2>
<p>The English Book store is a place for the <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> Teachers to hide their unwanted/unused books. Each Year Group normally does 1 book a year (with 1 one half of the year doing one book, the other half doing a different book), some Shakespeare, poems and whatever filler the English teachers can think of. The books that aren't being read by a year group at a certain time go here, or to the library.</p>
