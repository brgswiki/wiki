<p>There are 2 astroturfs, both of which are used for outdoor PE lessons.</p>
<h3>Lower/Bottom Astroturf</h3>
<p>This is the main one that BRGS uses as it is closer to the school and actually belongs to them. Luckily, because the grass is plastic, when the weather is snowy, frosty or too rainy (most days) it is considered dangerous and therefore cannot be used.</p>

<p>Sometimes when you have PE first period and the ground is still a little frosty you can draw things on it, and this often leads to a lot of body parts being drawn before the PE teachers come to actually teach. The PE teachers, rather than sprinting their way to astroturf lessons as their name may suggest, they often take a leisurely stroll and stop on the way for coffee and after about 20 minutes many think they have began to grow the coffee plant from scratch.</p>
<p>The Lower Astroturf is also the place where many events are held, from Sports Day to fire alarms.</p>
<h3>Higher/Top Astroturf</h3>
<p>This astroturf is shared with Waterfoot Primary School, and therefore isn't used as often. If you do use this astroturf though it is likely to be that one day when the weather exceeds the temperature of the Sun. Boys' PE lessons take place here more often than girls'.</p>
