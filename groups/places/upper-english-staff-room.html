<h2>Upper English Staff Room</h2>
<p>The Upper English Staff Room is the <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> Teachers's upstairs hideout. It is quite a decent size to say it is for the teachers of only one subject and is probably half the size of the <a href="/groups/places/small-staffroom">small main school staff room .</a></p>
