<h2>Upper English Staff Room</h2>
<p>The Upper English Staff Room is the <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> Teachers's upstairs hideout. It is quite a decent size to say it is for the teachers of only one subject and is probably half the size of the <a href="/groups/places/small-staffroom">small main school staff room .</a></p>
<p>The everyday student is seldom invited into this room (only English geniuses, like the next Charles Dickens) and teachers will hate you forever more if you ask for them whilst they are having a ‘break’ in here.</p>
