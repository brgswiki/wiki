<h2>Bike Shelter</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The bike shelter was built during the summer holidays between the 06/07 school year and 07/08. There are two mysterious bike racks that are not inside the shelter, they are on the left of it. These have been dubbed "the reject racks".</p>
<h3>Myths and legends</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The bike shelter is rumoured to be the entrance to the secret base of the teacher's own super-hero group, "Teach squad". They travel around the school fighting "crime" such as untidy uniform and poor GCSE grades.</li>
  <li>It is also rumoured to be the TARDIS, although nobody has yet found the entrance.</li>
  <li>The shelter was made with money that was originally going to be used for helpful things such as replacing the 20 year old textbooks or new display boards, but was instead used for keeping bikes (who are, contrary to Lord Morris' apparent beliefs, are inanimate).</li>
</ul>
