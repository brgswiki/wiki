<h2>English Staff Kitchen</h2>
<p>The English Staff Kitchen is a place for the <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> Teachers to make themselves' a tea and/or coffee between lessons. There's even a toaster in there if they need an emergency piece of toast. The room is really small, and you probably couldn't fit more than 3 people in at once.</p>
