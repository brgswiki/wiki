<h2>Cubby Hole</h2>
<p>Basically it's a hole in the wall. <a href="/students/intake20">Year 7</a>s flock there, considering it to be their special place. (No, I don't get it either.) The Cubby Hole is the area in front of school between rooms <a href="/groups/rooms/art/69">69</a> and <a href="/groups/rooms/food-tech/41">41</a> used by year 7s for their sporting ventures. Of course, even when the Year 7s are not using it, you will likely be flushed out of it by <a href="/teachers/other/welfare-staff">dinner ladies</a>. It is banned for older students to venture within this sacred area.</p>
<p>The famous fight of <a href="/students/intake18">Year 9 </a>(then year 8) took place here where they were spotted by <a href="/teachers/mr-spencer">Mr Spencer</a> and <a href="/teachers/mrs-kennedy">Mrs Kennedy</a> from the windows of Room 41 and made up the next few months of assembly topics.</p>
<p>You can no longer play ball games here much to a number of students' dismay. The area has now fallen into disrepair and is unbelievably mossy, although during winter a lot of snow collects here.</p>
