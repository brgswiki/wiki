<h2>Anglesey</h2>
<p>The trip for <a href="/students/intake18">Year 8,</a> at some camp in the middle of nowhere by the sea. It is classed as a Maths trip because in the evenings you do some quizzes where some of the answers are numbers. This year it was replaced with Edale which was basically supposed to be the same but STEM focused, although students are yet to experience it as covid-19 has unfortunately meant that the first Edale trip to be ran has been cancelled.</p>
<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>The most common first sight words upon seeing the building will be a mix of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Oh...</li>
  <li>It looks like a prison</li>
  <li>I think it's a mental asylum...</li>
</ul>
<p>It isn't really any different inside, the rooms still look like a prison cell.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>Depending on student numbers there will generally be two floors of rooms, one for girls and one for boys. In the very large building there are many rooms which will only be used once - for a shape making activity, but don't seem to have a purpose and are all named after tree types (rowan, birch, and oak if my memory serves me correctly). There is actually a shop that sells sweets but be careful as there are some really weird opening times.</p>
<p>The teachers usually have a lights-out policy for about 11/12pm which will usually fail. The teachers will inform everyone about how they can turn off all the rooms lights, but it will not stop them being turned on again, rendering it useless.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>There is the general activities that involves your typical raft building, archery, yadda yadda, but of course, because it is a Maths trip it wouldn't be complete without the Polyhedra Challenge (make some shapes out of card), the Maths Relay (speed working out maths problems then having to run across the hall for the next one for about an hour), and a lot of "maths" quizzes in the evenings.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One student's fond recollection of Anglesey includes "I remember I was praying in Anglesey and f*cking <a href="/teachers/mr-mercer">Mr Mercer</a> hit me with the door."</li>
</ul>
