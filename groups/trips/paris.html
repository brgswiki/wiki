<h2>Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is a trip ran for Year 7s usually somewhere at the end of May. You get there by coach, then ferry, then coach, then from place to place in Paris itself you get around by both coach and river boat depending if you got to the Eiffel Tower or not.</p>
<h2>The Hotel</h2>
<p>Most rooms have three people in them, and therefore a bunk bed and one normal bad. Be warned! Some of the normal beds have some weird creepy sun face on it. Try not to get a room near the teachers especially if you want to talk a lot.</p>
<h2>Disneyland</h2>
<p>You get to go around by yourself with friends in Disney land, but you need to register back with the teachers like very 5 minutes. Bring lots of water and suncream!</p>
<h2>The Eiffel Tower/Montparnasse Tower</h2>
<p>Depending on whether the school can get tickets or not, you either go to the Eiffel Tower or the Montparnasse Tower. Both of which just have a lot of people trying to sell you random junk like fidget spinners.</p>

<p>There is even a BRGS Paris Trip Twitter which can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/BrgsParis">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
