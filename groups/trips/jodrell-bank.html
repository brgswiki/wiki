<h2>Jodrell Bank</h2>
<p>This is a recently introduced <a href="/students/intake19">Year 7</a> trip that involves an hour coach journey, taking students to a satellite dish, talking for a long time, getting them to fill out questions they don't know the answers to and more often than not just steal the answers off the person next to them, more talking about it, and then a coach journey back.</p>
