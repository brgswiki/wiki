<h2>Waterfoot</h2>
<p>Each year since two years ago the <a href="/subjects/geography">geography</a> department decided it would be educational and valuable to take <a href="/students/intake19">Year 7</a>s to Waterfoot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is normally very cold and rainy, which is surprising because you'd expect the geography teachers to be able to check the weather forecast. A number of Year 7s almost get run over each year but they agreed it was worth it as you get out of lessons.</p>
<p>Afterwards, any class who came into the geography classrooms which served as a return base for the drenched year 7s were puzzled to find some kind of pond rather than Room 56.</p>
