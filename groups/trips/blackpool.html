<h2>Blackpool</h2>
<p>The fun day trip that <a href="/students/intake19">Year 8</a> and <a href="/students/intake17">Year 10</a> share during <a href="/groups/events/enrichment-week">Enrichment Week</a> as their day out. For the <a href="/students/intake16">2016 intake</a> however, this was all to change as the school decided they should be doing work experience instead of having a week off at the very end of a year of hard work (even despite <a href="/teachers/mrs-bowdler">Mrs Bowdler</a>'s protests). However, since covid this was unable to go ahead and so the future of the Year 10s' Blackpool Trip remains unknown…</p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Valhalla - if you go, leave it till last! (And bring waterproofs) But be prepared to have to queue for up to an hour (as kindly pointed out by one Geordie lady who upon spotted some kids queue jumping exclaimed “<i>THERE'S A <strong>KUYUHH</strong>.”)</i></li>
  <li>Wallace &amp; Gromit - can't explain it, just go - well worth it with a shop at the end that sells various wares that amount to 90% cheese flavoured rock.</li>
  <li>That one with the dinosaurs and other history stuff - always fun, another one I cannot explain but lets you go with all your mates on one boat so the experience has gone down in our memories</li>
</ul>
