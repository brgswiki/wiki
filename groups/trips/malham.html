<h2>Malham</h2>
<p>Yet another <a href="/subjects/geography">geography</a> trip, this one to some fields and rocks rather than the buildings down the road. It replaced the trip to the Yorkshire Dales &amp; Whitescar Dales for unknown reasons, presumably because Malham is said to be more impressive but personally I think some damp caves with Halloween decorations from months ago still up and low ceilings for people to bump their heads on is more fun.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Get to watch a number of people get their feet stuck in grykes</li>
  <li>You get some pretty good toffee</li>
  <li>Last but not least, you get to miss lessons</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
  <li>They force you to wear a coat with body guard like intentions</li>
  <li>You spend the next term discussing limestone on the trip and therefore it is debated if the trip is actually worth this struggle.</li>
</ul>
