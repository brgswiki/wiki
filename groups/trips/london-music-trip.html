<h1>London Trip 2020</h1>
<p>A school trip scheduled for 19<sup>th </sup>- 21<sup>st </sup>of March 2020 and organised by the <a href="/subjects/music">music</a> department (<a href="/teachers/mr-davenport">Mr Davenport</a> was the main man behind it). The trip was postponed on the 16<sup>th </sup>March 2020 (due to COVID-19) and later cancelled, due to the unpredictability of the school year ahead. Quite a good job, actually, as the school effectively closed on the 21<sup>st </sup>March, meaning we probably would have got some rude glares in Covent Garden and beyond.</p>
<p>The teachers expected to journey with us were <a href="/teachers/mr-mercer">Mr Mercer</a>, <a href="/teachers/mr-webber">Mr Webber</a>, Mr Davenport and Ms Swift.</p>
<h3>"The Tour That Never Toured!"</h3>
<p>After cancelling the tour, Mr Davenport put a message on the Google Classroom saying “The Tour that never toured! Come and collect your hoodies and wear them with pride!” The hoodies in question were a shade of “Find Kids in Covent Garden Blue”, ordered by the music department a couple of months before the tour was due to take place. The mad rush that lunch time for people to claim their hoodies resulted in long waiting times outside Mrs Blyfield's Office - some up to 15 minutes.</p>
