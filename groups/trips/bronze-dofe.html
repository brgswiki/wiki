<h2>Bronze DofE</h2>
<p>Organised and ran by none other that BRGS' resident camping expert - <a href="/teachers/mrs-chapman">Mrs Chapman</a>.</p>
<p>It starts off with everyone needing to sign on to the eDofE website which results in various technical difficulties. After this people forget they signed up for DofE and then realising the deadline is coming up sooner than expected quickly put down some easily achievable activities requiring minimal effort.</p>
<p>In the lead up to the expedition, Mrs Chapman suddenly springs on your group that you will need a theme/topic/goal/other synonym for your trip. In the past this has ranged from bridges to flora &amp; fauna but your group isn't told this and you just have to figure it out for yourself (for example our group originally opting for dinosaurs before realising what was intended).</p>
<p>You also get to spend half a lunchtime once a month or so in <a href="/groups/rooms/maths/c116">C116</a> trying to find Clitheroe on a map (be warned, one map has been cut in half in an unnoticeable way yet the half that is missing contains Clitheroe - upon taking twice as long as all the other groups and Mrs Chapman sending a couple of pitying comments she'll then exclaim â€˜ohh you ended up with the half map.')</p>
<p>The expedition - being incomplete by our year - seems to be a hike in which you carry an unnecessary amount of equipment for a two day trip.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The unnecessary equipment from the list from the top of my head</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gaiters - some waterproof things that are basically an extension of trousers</li>
  <li>Nutritious meal - for some reason 16 packets of instant noodles isn't a valid meal (for less than two days) and instead the DofE expects you to carry 7 courses for each meal that contain at least your 5 a day and follow the Eatwell Plate</li>
</ul>
