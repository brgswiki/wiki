<h2>Bronze DofE</h2>
<p>Organised and ran by none other that BRGS' resident camping expert - <a href="/teachers/mrs-chapman">Mrs Chapman</a>.</p>
<h3>Preparation (both mental and physical)</h3>
<p>It starts off with everyone needing to sign on to the eDofE website which results in various technical difficulties. After this people forget they signed up for DofE and then realising the deadline is coming up sooner than expected quickly put down some easily achievable activities requiring minimal effort.</p>
<p>In the lead up to the expedition, Mrs Chapman suddenly springs on your group that you will need a theme/topic/goal/other synonym for your trip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also get to spend half a lunchtime once a month or so in <a href="/groups/rooms/maths/c116">C116</a> trying to find Clitheroe on a map (be warned, one map has been cut in half in an unnoticeable way yet the half that is missing contains Clitheroe - upon taking twice as long as all the other groups and Mrs Chapman sending a couple of pitying comments she'll then exclaim â€˜ohh you ended up with the half map.')</p>
<p>^ You also get to do a practise expedition (or even the actual expedition) at Waddow Hall (which to Year 9 Campers may sound painfully familiar)</p>
<h3>The unnecessary equipment from the list from the top of my head</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gaiters - some waterproof things that are basically an extension of trousers</li>
  <li>Nutritious meal - for some reason 16 packets of instant noodles isn't a valid meal (for less than two days) and instead the DofE expects you to carry 7 courses for each meal that contain at least your 5 a day and follow the Eatwell Plate</li>
</ul>
<h3>DofE itself</h3>
<p>Pretty good if you don't mind dragging a 15kg rucksack for a 20km walk each day (whilst the recommended amount is 10-15 your group will either get lost or become cocky whilst planning out routes), otherwise the highlights will be eating the best tasting pot noodles you've ever had (which only taste good out of pity for you).</p>
