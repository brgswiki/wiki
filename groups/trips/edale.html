<h2>Edale</h2>
<p>Little is known about this trip as no one has actually gone on it yet. The current <a href="/students/intake18">Year 9s</a> were supposed to go on it at the end of last year, but alas the corona forbid that from happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a few (probably) concrete facts about this trip:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is meant to be replacing <a href="/groups/trips/anglesey">Anglesey</a></li>
  <li>Rather than maths oriented Anglesey, Edale is STEM based</li>
  <li>It is likely to involve a number of outdoor activities</li>
  <li><a href="/teachers/mrs-chapman">Mrs Chapman</a> will no doubt be organising and running every aspect of the trip, just like every other trip</li>
  <li>The weather will probably make any outdoor activities a struggle</li>
</ul>
