<h2>Ingleborough</h2>
<p>If you get bored by limestone, you may not find this the most exciting of trips, although it is compulsory as you spend the next term or so in <a href="/subjects/geography">geography</a> talking about this trip.</p>
<h3>The General Trip</h3>
<p>First off, you come to school wearing normal clothes, then depart on a magical journey over many various A-roads to eventually come to the village of Clapham. Two forms go each day so after 3 days each form will have been on this trip. Because we were on this trip we missed BRGS' first lockdown drill so the year after we had no idea what to do. The two forms split up, one going into White Scar Caves, the other venturing off into the countryside. In the caves, be sure to bash your head a few times just to get used to it - you will do that a lot and see many strangely shaped limestone features. Apparently it is always a joy to hear from our school when <a href="/teachers/mr-spencer">Mr Spencer</a> does the annual booking (although not anymore as school has now upgraded to <a href="/groups/trips/malham">Malham</a> for whatever reason).</p>
<h3>Limestone Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Devils Tongue - apparently will give you bad luck if it drips on you... "I caught some in my mouth and my luck improved, try it!"</li>
  <li>Damocles' Sword - a rather sharp looking stalagmite that got broken by 'some young punks'.</li>
  <li>Judge's Head - a tiny little limestone head the looks like one of those judges with a wig on.</li>
  <li>Halloween decorations - BRGS students normally go to Whitescar Caves sometime in the autumn, meaning that when you go into the caves you are greeted by plastic skeletons, fake smoke, and a lot of the water is lit up with green lights. Arguably, this makes the caves relatively more interesting.</li>
  <li>Limestone pavements - At least one student falls into the gryke each year and gets their foot stuck which is normally the highlight of the trip for everyone else (apart from sitting down and having lunch).</li>
</ul>
