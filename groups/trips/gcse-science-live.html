<h2>GCSE Science Live</h2>
<p>GCSE Science Live is an interesting day out if you are into science, otherwise the trip mostly involves backache from the chairs, headache from having to sit in silence all day, and generally a lot of pointing out people who have fallen asleep from other schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At some point some important exams guy speaks and tells you about all the different type of exam questions - and even though this is very vital information, it is much harder to try not falling asleep than the actual science GCSE exam itself.</p>
<p>If you don't go, you get put into a mixed class with all the other stragglers and literally get to play Kahoot all day.</p>
<p>The science lessons in the weeks leading up to this event are usually filled with your science teacher insisting what a brilliant event it is and hyping you up for it, only for the day itself to arrive and you'd rather still be doing actual lessons at school.</p>
