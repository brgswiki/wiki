<h2>Salford Quays</h2>
<p>This is a <a href="/subjects/geography">geography</a> trip taken at GCSE, as part of the human geography topic.</p>
<p>When we asked <a href="/teachers/miss-foster">Miss Foster</a> what would happen on this trip she told us it was just getting to look around the Christmas markets. This is a lie. The <i>teachers</i> get to go to the Christmas markets. Students have to go around asking people to fill in surveys and actually socially interact with random strangers - which is arguably harder than the geography GCSE itself.</p>
<h3>Memories</h3>
<p>One year group got a rare glimpse of a wild BJ leaving a conference.</p>
