<h2>Activity Day</h2>
<p>The last week of school is of course the famous Enrichment Week, and for some reason BRGS likes to get rid of everyone on the Wednesday by sending them off to somewhere, for <a href="/students/intake18">Yr 8</a> this is Blackpool, for <a href="/students/intake17">Yr 9</a> this is Year 9 Camp, for <a href="/students/intake16">Yr 10</a> it <i>was </i>Blackpool but is now Work Experience (despite a lot of resistance from <a href="/teachers/mrs-bowdler">Mrs Bowdler</a>), and of course Yr 11s are off on their holidays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For <a href="/students/intake19">Year 7s</a> however, BRGS likes to send them to some lake to do a bunch of Scout like activities such as canoeing or archery. Bring a fleece! It is usually very cold and they make you jump in the (freezing) lake at the end.</p>
