<h2>Ypres &amp; the Somme</h2>
<p>Life changing, but definitely bring a warm coat.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Seeing a spoon with a bullet hole in it, unfortunately rendering it useless</li>
  <li>Hearing the Last Post at least 17 times</li>
  <li>The hotel rooms</li>
</ul>
<h3>Memories</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The food which no one really was sure what it was… even <a href="/teachers/trainee/mr-rimmer">Mr Rimmer</a> was clueless…</li>
  <li>Arriving at the car park to get on the coaches and seeing <a href="/teachers/past/miss-winchester">Miss Winchester</a> arrive with a duvet and two pillows, along with all her luggage</li>
  <li>The bunk beds in the hotel rooms are lethal - you can easily remove the ladders leading to your roommates having to do involuntary parkour around the hotel room…</li>
</ul>
<h3>Easy mistakes to make</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Eating the hotel food. Don't. It's not worth it - bring your own (or order a pizza)</li>
  <li>Not bringing warm clothes - walking around fields is considerably less fun without suitable outerwear</li>
  <li>The hotel room walls are paper thin, watch out what you say especially if none other than <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr P</a> himself is outside the door.</li>
</ul>
