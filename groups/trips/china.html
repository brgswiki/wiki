<h2>China</h2>
<p>One of the ‘big’ trips BRGS hosts every two years - meaning students who join BRGS in an even year get to go on a ‘big’ trip twice, so blame your parents for that otherwise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years China has alternated with a trip to America, however the 2019 China Trip is the last trip to China BRGS will be hosting following a leak that they will only now travel to America from now on, or perhaps choose another country to alternate with. Reasons for this are unknown but likely down to the less than relaxed atmosphere including being followed by likely government people around sites of tourist interest.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sticky rice - available at every meal including breakfast, and of course only chopsticks to eat it with. After coming back from the trip many couldn't so much as look at another grain of rice. (The other meal choices were perhaps less palatable.)</li>
  <li>Sleeper trains - very fun, about a 6ft² room to share with 4 people and all your luggage. There is a convenient luggage compartment where you can sit in and jump out at anyone coming in (make sure this is not a staff member, otherwise you are in for a long winded and concerned health and safety talk). A sleeper train memory that comes to mind is a drunk <a href="/teachers/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a> and Mrs Hughes lying in the train corridor finding a box of pastries the most funny thing in the world, only second to some ice lollies.</li>
  <li>Food shopping - Upon being given 30¥ (about £3) each by the staff to buy some food in a supermarket (to be a substantial meal and breakfast for on a sleeper train!), it was at the time considered a good idea to pitch together with friends - yet this was later regretted when getting on the train and unpacking what you had bought for a meal. In our case, we had: a loaf of bread, ridiculous number of weird crispy biscuits, box of grapes, macha tea biscuits, and some cheese wafers - at the time of buying this had all seemed like a great idea but we soon realised we weren't ever going to be dietary advisers.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>HOT. Very hot.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>3 out of the 4 tour guides being called Jason. The most memorable two was the Jason who wore his glasses upside down so in admiration his whole coach also wore their (sun)glasses upside down too. The other Jason was the one who beat <a href="/teachers/mr-chambers">Mr Chambers</a> in the high jump. After a stop in a pottery museum, about an hour into the journey, <a href="/teachers/mrs-sawle">Mrs Sawle</a> commented “Oh wow it's quiet in here, for once Jason isn't talking and we can have some quiet.” - upon arriving at the next destination it turned out we had left Jason behind at the pottery museum a two hour drive back.</li>
  <li>The flags - BRGS commissioned some little flags for each team leader to hold with the squirrel logo on it so we could find them better. Extra credit goes to Mrs Sawle who adorned her's in Octonauts stickers.</li>
  <li>Some guy trying to bring back a sword - neither the airport security or Mr Reeves were very amused.</li>
</ul>
