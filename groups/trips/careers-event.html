<h2>Careers Fair</h2>
<p>In <a href="/students/intake19">Year 8</a>, the council or something kindly (or not so kindly depending on your opinion) hosts a careers fair for Rossendale students. You get to go to some sports centre and talk to people, pretending to be interested in engineering, in exchange for a free keyring.</p>
<p>The highlights of this trip include: gaining a number of freebies, making some tacos, and keeping a beachball in the air with a leaf-blower.</p>
<p>There are only a few careers, and these seem to come back at every single careers fair. Unfortunately, not everyone wants to go into these jobs and just stand around pretending you love landscape designing. The stalls mostly include: the army, engineers, care homes, and landscape design.</p>
<h3>Careers Fair '18</h3>
<p>One student was told by a person on the army stall "there are no jobs for hairdressers in the army" simply because she was a girl. Later that day we had <a href="/teachers/miss-hartley">Miss Hartley</a> and the student told her the story. Miss Hartley stopped the lesson and spent the rest of the hour composing an angry email with our class to the careers people. Unfortunately, I am unsure if she ever got a reply back from them.</p>
