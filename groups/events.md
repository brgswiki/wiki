# Events
BRGS hosts many events each year, however like many of other things, there seem to be less and less, and the once well-liked plethora of activities has been replaced with what feels like a daily bake sale and the occasional non-uniform day.

### Events from a long gone era...
Over the past many years, BRGS has hosted a number of events. Unfortunately, as the school has become more education based (for some strange reason) many of these have been scrapped and all that remains of them is people wishing for them to be brought back.
