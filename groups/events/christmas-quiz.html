<h2>Christmas Quiz</h2>
<p>There is sometimes a Christmas Quiz, sometimes not, with the most recent one being hosted in the 2017/18 school year. Although they are fun to take part in, if it goes ahead just depends if teachers are interested in spending a lunchtime trying to organise a bunch of (mostly) <a href="/students/intake19">Year 8</a>s and <a href="/students/intake18">9</a>s and have the willpower to part with the chocolate prize at the end (often not).</p>
<p>Like most quizzes, it consists of guessing songs, movie titles, and dingbats.</p>
