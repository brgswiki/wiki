<h2>Parents Evening</h2>
<p>Parents Evening is that joyous, annual event who everyone dreads, albeit for different reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In lower school, this usually requires you to pre-book three minute long appointments with your teachers via insight, which are completely and utterly pointless, as you will always be stuck behind a parent who insists on having a 30 minute discussion about why their child should have a B+ and not just a B, and before you know it the whole evening has descended into chaos and delay with the bell ringing every 3 minutes to try and rush teachers and parents along.</p>
<p>It is very rare you will actually finish a chat with a teacher in less than 3 minutes so it is unsure why it is organised this way.</p>
<p>Some teachers get fully booked very quickly, these are often the nice ones that students hope will spout some story about being conscientious and a quiet yet thoughtful student to their parents. Other teachers often has less visitors as they have a tendency to be (somewhat brutally) honest, one example from the bright and cheerful <a href="/teachers/miss-wilkes">Miss Wilkes</a> includes: <i>Miss Wilkes looks from parent to parent, before whispering loudly with a look of terror </i>“Your son…" (leans in) "…<i>is <strong>horrid</strong>.”</i></p>
