<h2>Christmas Assemblies</h2>
<p>Every year students around the school look forward toward the annual Christmas assembly. It celebrates the end of the year, you get a chance to listen to some songs, but most importantly: you usually miss two periods of the morning. In recent years, Christmas assemblies have been transformed from you listening to the same dull songs over again with terrible cuts in the audio in the PowerPoint video playing the songs, to Mr Porteous playing his beloved inflatable saxophone and a whole teacher TikTok marathon.</p>
<p>These assemblies happen in the sports hall, to barely fit in the whole school in, along with the band which performs some Christmas songs.</p>
<h3>2018</h3>
<p>A very standard assembly, some songs were played, we were reminded about the values of Christmas and how they coincided with BRGS values (since that was still a remembered thing back then) and the band playing Christmas songs didn't experience the same jarring cuts the singalong PowerPoint presentation did.</p>
<h3>2019</h3>
<p>At first this assembly seemed to be the same as 2018's Christmas assembly, with still awful cuts in the singalong video and a quite loud band blasting Christmas songs, all until Mr Porteous came onto stage, which an inflatable saxophone, and started to bust some moves to the song "Merry Christmas Everyone", this also caused a large number of students to take out their phones and their flashes on; honestly I'm surprised the teachers didn't freak out about this, but then again they were wearing really bright illuminated Christmas jumpers and did project colourful patterns on the ceiling. This moment has been immortalised in students' heads and the BRGS meme pages.</p>
<h3>2020</h3>
<p>Due to coronavirus, it seemed that all hope for Mr Porteous absolutely blasting his saxophone this year was all lost, along with the prospect of a Christmas assembly in general, as seen by this post from BRGSmemes123.</p>

<p>This was all a lie by the meme pages, on the 17th December 2020, we were graced with a Google Meet livestreamed PowerPoint, running at a great framerate of two (still better than Cyberpunk). All seemed normal at first with Mr Porteous reminding us that the coronavirus filled year of 2020 was hard and convincing himself that we were deeply upset when we had to be sent home to self isolate.</p>
<p>The whole mood of the assembly changed when this video was shown.</p>

<p>When this video was watched over the Google Meet livestream, the framerate was two and this isn't an exaggeration, but the video was hard to watch.</p>
<p>That was a great morning, then terrible for the students that had to do more mocks. Additionally, in period 5, a second part of the assembly was held to announce awards for students in each year.</p>
