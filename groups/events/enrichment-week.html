<h2>Enrichment Week</h2>
<p>Enrichment Week is that once fun, now educational week that takes place on the last week of the school year. Whilst the Year 7s and 8s get to do fun things, Year 10s are doing work experience, 11s are off after their exams, and 9s are on the infamous <a href="/groups/trips/year-9-camp">Year 9 Camp.</a> Some of the fun events that have taken place in the past include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jewellery making with <a href="/teachers/past/mr-fitton">Mr Fitton</a></li>
  <li>Meditation with <a href="/teachers/miss-butterworth">Miss Butterworth</a></li>
  <li>Gardening behind the maths block (but only as DofE was cancelled)</li>
  <li>Making gingerbread houses</li>
  <li>Recording a news story</li>
  <li>Making the form room into an escape room</li>
  <li>Junk band</li>
</ul>
