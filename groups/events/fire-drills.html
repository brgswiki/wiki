<h2>Fire Drill</h2>
<p>The Fire Drill occurs about twice a year; one time it is announced in advance to all students, the other time is a "secret" which only the staff know about. However, it always occurs ten minutes into a lesson, and a tell-tale sign is the fact the teacher will ramble on about something irrelevant for far longer than usual to bide time.</p>
<p>Once the fire alarm sounds, students proceed to the <a href="/groups/places/astroturfs">Astroturf</a> where registers are taken and people are shouted at to get into a straight line through an ineffective megaphone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is rare that the fire alarm is set off by a real fire. On other, more recent occasions, the fire has been set off on purpose a couple of times resulting in a staff member guarding each fire alarm for the next month, the fire alarm has been set off by a student leaning against one, students being pushed against the one by the Canteen entrance, a chair being thrown into one, someone soldering plastic in an electronics lesson and the kettle in the <a href="/groups/places/small-staffroom">staffroom</a> boiling underneath a smoke detector.&nbsp;</p>
