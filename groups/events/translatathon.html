<h2>Translatathon</h2>
<p>The Translatathon is a recently introduced event, albeit very competitive! You get thrown in a group with random students from other year groups (since different year groups do different languages) and then have to translate sentences from <a href="/subjects/french">French</a> to <a href="/subjects/spanish">Spanish</a> and so on.</p>
<p>There are a number of photos on boards around school from these events - making these the only recently updated notice boards in school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event takes place in the hall and often results in your group frantically screaming words in various languages to each other whilst simultaneously trying to get the lion's share of the biscuits and crisps kindly bought by the <a href="/subjects/mfl">MFL department</a> for each team.</p>
