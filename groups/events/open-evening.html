<h2>Open Evening</h2>
<p>Annual event taking place in June, although it is aimed at Year 5s and 6s, I cannot recommend attending as a student enough.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Post Open Evening</h3>
<p>The school day ends one hour earlier so the staff can prepare for the hordes of sprogs and their parents by quickly updating the dates on notice boards from the last open evening, hiding any gum-ridden or graffitied chairs in an empty classroom, and setting out bowls of snacks in an effective way to make their subject appeal to prospective students.</p>
<p>This also allows you and any mates to hang out for a bit before returning to the school later. Would recommend getting chips but be prepared to have a run in with <a href="/teachers/past/mr-fitton">Mr Fitton</a> and have to talk about the Engineer (magazine) whilst you all wait for your hefty order of chips.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, the park at the bottom of the road isn't a too shabby place to eat your chips but again, be warned, as <a href="/teachers/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a> likes to patrol around BRGS combatting exactly this and exasperatingly exclaim “<i>This is a park for children.” </i>forgetting that students are indeed children themselves and any other children are still at school (if this is the case just migrate to the other park a couple of metres down the road but again be prepared with sassy comebacks to chavvy road men otherwise you won't make it out alive).</p>
<p>If you find yourself bored of the rusty haunted playground, head down to Waterfoot Aquatics where you can spot some fancy looking fish, or go up behind school to finish your <a href="/other/co-op">co-op</a> bought snacks in a picnic soaking up the rest of the sun with a packet of monster munch.</p>
<p>After you've had enough gallivanting around the sights of Waterfoot with at least another hour to kill, it is time to head up to school where you can perhaps be of use to hastily preparing teachers. (If you are ever asked to find some coat-hangers, go to Miss Foster!) Otherwise, you can already help yourself to snacks (the MFL department are particularly notorious for this, even having garlic bread and pretzels) and look through the pictures of trips set out and recoil in horror as you spot a much younger version of you.</p>
<h3>Mid Open Evening</h3>
<p>The masses arrive… My best advice is to find a square foot of free ground and stick to it for as long as you can. Don't be a tour guide unless you enjoy being used by pushy parents who ask questions even <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a> himself may not know how to answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, help in a subject - either <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> as if you're bad enough they'll let you take half the time off, <a href="/subjects/dt">DT</a> - you get loads of free BRGS merchandise, or <a href="/subjects/mfl">MFL</a> - you have to teach kids how to count which is a horrible and painstaking task especially after you say “Four?” after telling them 7 times and a mass of children still repeat back to you a jumble of “zwei” “troix” and “ocho” but it is well worth it for the food.</p>
<p>There are also some fun talks going on where either Mr Reeves or Mr Porteous repeats the iconic speech of “BRGS is not a building yadda yadda” before quickly ushering on some poor student who had to rush and make a speech about how much they love BRGS after the original student has coincidentally fallen ill.</p>
<p>The two hours feel forever but it is soon over and you have a new treasured memory from BRGS.</p>
