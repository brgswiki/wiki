<h2>Non-Uniform Day</h2>
<p>A classic scam pulled off by a number of schools where you pay to wear your own clothes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There seemed to be a theme in the past to each non uniform day - of which there were a lot - however now it seems to have been reduced to once a term with the only theme being “NO BUMS NO BOOBS NO BELLIES” (© Copyright <a href="/teachers/mrs-bowdler">Mrs Bowdler</a>).</p>
<p>The most worn outfit is just a classic jeans and hoodie - much to <a href="/teachers/mrs-wharmby">Mrs Wharmby</a>'s dismay.</p>
