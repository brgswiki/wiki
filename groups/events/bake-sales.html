<h2>Bake Sales</h2>
<p>This is BRGS' most commonly used method of fundraising - being made up of either student made bakes or simply a quick visit to the <a href="/other/co-op">Co-op</a> (likely resulting in some strange glances from customers as they see sixth formers wander by with a trolley full of cakes).</p>
<p>Taking place at break, a Bake Sale transforms the hall temporarily into a stampede (mostly <a href="/students/intake20">Year 7</a>s) where often the best cakes and biscuits are gone within the first 30 seconds as Year 7s who are let out of lesson early make a beeline to the hall and finish them off faster than locusts.</p>
<p>In a turn of events, during covid times, BRGS decided that they would still host a Bake Sale but instead you pay to bake your own cake at home and then eat your own cake at home (although you get a chance of having a photo of your masterpiece on the <a href="https://twitter.com/BRGS_1701">school's twitter</a>, and the money goes to charity).</p>
