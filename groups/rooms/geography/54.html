<h2>Room 54</h2>
<p>Room 54 is a <a href="/subjects/geography">geography</a> classroom. This is <a href="/teachers/mr-spencer">Mr Spencer's</a> room, and therefore be warned - do not break the box of new crayons! He will never forgive you.</p>
<p>Like all geography <a href="/groups/rooms">classrooms</a>, it is along the Extension corridor and is a pain to get into as the corridor gets very cramped.</p>
<p>Back in the days it used to be a maths room.</p>
