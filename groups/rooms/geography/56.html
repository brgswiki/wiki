<p>Room 56 is a geography classroom. It is also Miss Leah's room.</p>
<p>Like all geography classrooms, it is along the Extension corridor however unlike the other geography classrooms it is placed underneath a high number of music classrooms and therefore most geography lessons in this room are accompanied by a <a href="/students/intake19">Year 7</a>'s poor rendition of 'Can you feel the love tonight?' for the whole lesson.</p>
<p>All the geography rooms also recently got the same treatment as the rooms in the hall and therefore got painted 'prison grey', along with some new grey chairs and tables, giving all the classrooms a very miserable look overall.</p>
