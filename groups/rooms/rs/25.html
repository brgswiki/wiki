<h2>Room 25</h2>
<p>Room 25 is an RS classroom off the hall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;teaches a lot in this room, and as a result of this the walls and display boards are bare, giving the room an even more depressing sheen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This room also has a funny smell, and whichever form is unlucky enough to have this room often finds themselves coming into school with their bag filled with perfume &amp; spray deodorant.&nbsp;</p>
