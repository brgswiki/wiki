<p>Room 24 is an RS classroom in the hall. It is mostly used by <a href="/teachers/miss-butterworth">Miss Butterworth</a> and therefore the cupboards are filled with a plethora of things, ranging from copious amounts of DVDs to a Jesus teddy. On the windowsills there are also a number of objects which are fun to look at if you are lucky enough to sit next to the window.&nbsp;</p>
