<h2>C015</h2>
<p>C015 is a <a href="/subjects/maths">Maths</a> Classroom in the Clark Building which is often taught in by <a href="/teachers/miss-powell">Miss Powell</a>. On particularly adequately hot days in summer you may have a view of teachers (mainly consisting of Maths and <a href="/subjects/pe">PE</a> teachers and Miss Gore-Ward) having a picnic on the ‘beach’.</p>
