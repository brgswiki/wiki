<p>C116 is <a href="/teachers/mrs-chapman">Mrs Chapman</a>'s classroom. It is ridiculously long and therefore people on either end of the classroom cannot actually see the board.</p>
<p>This is also the room where a ceiling tile fell from the roof and therefore covered the back corner of the classroom in bits of smashed ceiling for a few days, despite the destruction Mrs Chapman had a very calm response.</p>
<p>On the walls of C116 you can find photos from a Year 9 Camp from probably a few decades ago, some mathsy related posters, and some paper shapes on the windows.</p>
