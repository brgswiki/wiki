<h2>C117</h2>
<p>C117 is a maths classroom which <a href="/teachers/mr-wilbraham">Mr Wilbraham</a> often teaches in. Notable things in the room include textbooks, textbooks, textbooks and more textbooks (Wilbo's favorite things). Luckily for the pupils that have to do the lockdown drill in there, there are very few pieces of chewing gum under the table (there's still thousands, just not as many as the other classrooms).</p>
