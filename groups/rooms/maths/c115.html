<h2>C115</h2>
<p>C115 is a <a href="/subjects/maths">Maths</a> Classroom in the Clark Building in which <a href="/teachers/miss-whitaker">Miss Whitaker</a> often teaches. She likes to claim on many occasion that it is her classroom, however cannot lock out her form despite the absolute bomb site it gets left in every lunchtime.</p>
<h3>Fun features IKEA designers are sure to steal from this classroom:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The folded up and dismembered mini plastic Christmas tree in the back corner, really brightens up the classroom</li>
  <li>Various political figure collage slowly expanding over the whiteboard, alongside Rick Astley.</li>
  <li>The hole in the wall at the back of the classroom some poor soul clearly tried to get out of a maths lesson only to die of boredom a fraction of the way through and alas never complete their escape route.</li>
</ul>
