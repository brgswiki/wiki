<h2>C014</h2>
<p>C014 is a <a href="/subjects/maths">Maths</a> Classroom in the Clark Building which is usually home to <a href="/teachers/miss-ogle">Miss Ogle</a> and provides a great view over the road and a few trees. If you look closely enough at the cabinet on the right of the classroom, you can see some dents in the metal, apparently from a student who once repeatedly ran into the cabinet.</p>
