<h2>C114</h2>
<p>C114 is a <a href="/subjects/maths">Maths</a> Classroom in the Clark Building which is often taught in by <a href="/teachers/mrs-sawle">Miss Sawle</a>. This is the last classroom on the corridor towards MFL that has actually been updated this century.</p>
<p>Do not be fooled however by it's supposedly recent furnishings, the paint on the back wall is already peeling off, and since there are no blinds in this particular classroom half of the class can't see the board at any one point in the day (given that the sun is out).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly any displays on the wall are from students long gone, and any time I've set foot in here the interactive board is having a minor crisis, most memorably when <a href="/teachers/dr-heaton">Dr Heaton</a> first had issues with the board in <a href="/groups/rooms/maths/c116">C116</a>, then moving to <a href="/groups/rooms/maths/c115">C115</a>, and eventually to C114 only to find the temperamental board refusing to cooperate with his demands. He spent at least half an hour trying different wire combinations for the sole purpose of having a question up on the board, easily written on the whiteboard by hand in less than 5 minutes. This riveting event has been caught on camera and can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/0pFz99qp_X4">here</a>, however I would only recommend if you have 15 minutes to spare you don't ever need back. The video ends once <a href="/teachers/mr-reeves">Reeves</a> was called for backup however being a witness to these events I can assure you the ordeal continued but instead of just one man and his doctorate trying to fix the board, it just became two men and a doctorate looking at the board in a lost and despairing manner whilst it told them ‘no signal’.</p>
