<h2>Room 37</h2>
<p>A <a href="/subjects/textiles">textiles</a> room on the lower <a href="/groups/places/basement-corridor">basement</a> corridor. Filled with sewing machines, both Janome and Bernina models (whether that is good or not we'll never know, but most lessons you have to get <a href="/teachers/past/mrs-reynard">Mrs Reynard</a> to fix the machine for you).</p>
<p>There are some strange things in this room, mostly scraps of neon coloured fabrics and deformed pillows made by Year 7s.</p>
<p>Whenever there isn't a class in here - not often as only Year 7s and 8s get textiles - this room is locked. This isn't very helpful especially when you are sent on an errand to find some coat hangers somewhere in the school building, and Room 37 would be your best (if only) bet.</p>
