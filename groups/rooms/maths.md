# Maths Classrooms
All the maths classrooms can be found in the new extension to the Clark building, they all have a similar colour scheme and darkened windows that look like mirrors from the outside. Despite the so called newness of the building, it isn't hard to miss the fallen ceiling tiles (sitting in C116 can be like maths student Russian roulette), the cobwebs in corners, or peeling paint.
