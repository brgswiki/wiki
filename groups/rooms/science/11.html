<h2>Room 11</h2>
<p>Room 11 is a <a href="/subjects/biology">biology</a> classroom, like <a href="/groups/rooms/science/9">Room 9</a> it is tucked in the top corner of the <a href="/groups/places/balcony">balcony</a>. In the old days this room used to be an <a href="/subjects/art">art</a> room. This room is mostly taught in by <a href="/teachers/dr-jackson">Dr Jackson</a> nowadays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like Rooms 9 and <a href="/groups/rooms/science/10">10</a> it has a view of the <a href="/groups/places/belfry">belfry</a> and therefore in lesson you can see a number of pigeons which are likely going to be more interesting than the biology lesson.</p>
