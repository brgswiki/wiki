<p>Room 1 is a chemistry classroom in which Miss Bowden teaches in a lot. Unless you take an A-level science (in particular chemistry) or have a room change, it is unlikely that you will have stepped foot in here.</p>

<p>The room itself is a terrible design, featuring desks smaller than the book you are trying to write in, and chairs not unlike plastic lawn furniture. It is possibly meant to replicate a lecture hall.</p>
<p>Room 1 was also where the 'Class from Hell' videos were filmed.</p>
