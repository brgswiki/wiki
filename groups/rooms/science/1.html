<p>Room 1 is a <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a> classroom in which <a href="/teachers/past/miss-bowden">Miss Bowden</a> teaches in a lot. Unless you take an A-level <a href="/subjects/science">science</a> (in particular chemistry) or have a room change, it is unlikely that you will have stepped foot in here.</p>
<p>The room itself is a terrible design, featuring desks smaller than the book you are trying to write in, and chairs not unlike plastic lawn furniture. It is possibly meant to replicate a lecture hall.</p>
<p>Room 1 was also where the '<a href="/other/class-from-hell">Class from Hell</a>' videos were filmed.</p>
