<h2>Room 7</h2>
<p>Room 7 is the only physics classroom off the balcony. This room is mainly used by <a href="/teachers/miss-morris">Miss Morris</a>, and has a secret door to both <a href="/teachers/mrs-porteous">Mrs Porteous</a>' office and Room 6 (the lab technicians' room).</p>
<h3>Physics Cat</h3>
<p>Of course, Room 7 is famed for being a shrine to <a href="/subjects/physics/physics-cat">Physics Cat</a>. The walls are adorned with all sorts of physics, cats, or tea-related memes. The first few lessons you spend in this room are often spent trying to read each and every poster, however every time you are in this room you discover something new.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Aye-Aye</h3>
<p>On the door of Room 7 used to be an aye-aye photo. It has since been taken down but many cannot forget.</p>
