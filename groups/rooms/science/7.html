<h2>Room 7</h2>
<p>Room 7 is the only physics classroom off the balcony. This room is mainly used by <a href="/teachers/miss-morris">Miss Morris</a>, and has a secret door to both <a href="/teachers/mrs-porteous">Mrs Porteous</a>' office and <a href="/groups/rooms/other/6">Room 6</a> (the lab technicians' room).</p>
<p>Over the past year or so it has had a revamp, having not been onto the balcony since and unable to see from a covert mission into the hall we can only hope all the physics memes are still in place.</p>
<h3>Physics Cat</h3>
<p>Of course, Room 7 is famed for being a shrine to <a href="/subjects/physics/physics-cat">Physics Cat</a>. The walls are adorned with all sorts of physics, cats, or tea-related memes. The first few lessons you spend in this room are often spent trying to read each and every poster, however every time you are in this room you discover something new.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Aye-Aye</h3>
<p>On the door of Room 7 used to be an aye-aye photo. It has since been taken down but many cannot forget.</p>
<p>UPDATE: The aye-aye is being reinstated &lt;333</p>
<h3>The Olden Days</h3>
<p>&nbsp;In the past, older students would wrap newer students in rugs and then put them down the coal chute from Room 7 to the old boiler house... dear Year 7s, keep this in mind before being cocky to us older years, don't tempt us...</p>
<h3>Fairy Godmother's Cupboard</h3>
<p>Have you seen the ghost that haunts Room 7? The figure who appears and then vanishes again without a trace as soon as you turn your back? Have you too looked up from graffitiing the desks only to see this lady steal a stapler from Miss Morris' desk and then disappear in a puff of smoke?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This my dear friends, is no ghost, but instead the legendary Mrs Porteous, using the door to her office to slip in and out unnoticed. Perhaps you are wondering which door - unseen by many's first glance, hidden under a plastering of memes and comic strips, only noticeable by the one picture of a seagull and another sign labelling it ‘fairy godmother’s cupboard'.</p>
<p>One class, naturally assuming the door labelled ‘cupboard’ was in fact a cupboard for ¾ of the year, had the fright of their lives when Mrs Porteous emerged to nick a pen and then retreated again all unnoticed by Miss Morris who was teaching at the whiteboard. Some were led to believe she had been locked in said cupboard by Miss Morris until she quickly explained BRGS' slapdash architecture.</p>
