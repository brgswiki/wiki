<h2>Room 10</h2>
<p>This room is mostly taught in by <a href="/teachers/mr-flynn">Mr Flynn</a>, as it is a biology room. It follows the same modern colour scheme and furniture choices as <a href="/groups/rooms/science/9">Rooms 9</a> and 11, soon to be rolled out to <a href="/groups/rooms/science/1">Room 1</a>, 12 and 13.</p>
<p>Along the walls are lots of pictures of animals which are always interesting to look at when the <a href="/subjects/biology">biology</a> lesson is particularly tedious.</p>
