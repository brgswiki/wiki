<h2>Room 5</h2>
<p>Room 5 is a <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a> classroom where <a href="/teachers/mrs-stevenson-jones">Mrs Stevenson-Jones</a> teaches a lot. It has a "wonderful distracting view" of Waterfoot and the hills beyond, which offer some salvation from chemistry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Along with the iconic old graffitied benches and desks, in Room 5 you can still see the chalkboard behind the projector screen, still with some chalk writing on it in fact - although this is illegible it is more than likely it was a student's cry for help during a particularly tedious lesson.</p>
<h3>Whiteboard Pens</h3>
<p>Of course, we could not forget to mention, Room 5 has a lot of shelves and outcrops beyond Mrs Stevenson-Jones' reach which a lot of last year's <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/students/intake16">Year 10s</a> have taken advantage of and used it to place her <a href="/other/whiteboard-pens">whiteboard pens</a>. Fortunately, Mrs Stevenson-Jones sees the funny side of this (probably because she's not tall enough to see the other side).</p>
