<p>Room 3 is a chemistry classroom off the balcony. Often noted for being chilly and surprisingly dark. On an unrelated note, <a href="/teachers/miss-hartley">Miss Hartley</a> often teaches in this room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Room 3 also has a lot of doors, leading to both the Chambers of Secrets and Room 4.</p>
