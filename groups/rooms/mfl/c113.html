<h2>C113</h2>
<p>C113 is a MFL classroom in which <a href="/teachers/miss-rowan">Miss Rowan</a> often teaches. It has <a href="/subjects/mfl">MFL</a> posters all over all 4 walls and a non interactive board. Like the rest of the MFL classrooms, the room really needs an upgrade - the tables have evidently been there since the classroom was constructed back in the 90s. The amount of chewing is disgraceful and evidently hasn't been cleaned ever either. The classroom has a lovely view over Waterfoot (annoying covered mainly by a tree in the summer months) which you can gaze out into if you are ever listening to a particularly tedious listening exercise.</p>
