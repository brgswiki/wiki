<h2>Room 4</h2>
<p>Room 4 is a storage room for the lab technicians. No one actually knows what is in this room although the door has a lot of danger stickers and 'dangerous chemicals' warnings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is more of a cupboard really although BRGS probably just gave it a number so they could boast they had more rooms in the newspaper when the main building was first built.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is one of the only <a href="/subjects/science">science</a> related rooms not to be connected to another.</p>
