<h2>Room 6</h2>
<p>This is one of the prep rooms on the <a href="/groups/places/balcony">balcony</a>. It is also a hangout for the lab technicians and <a href="/subjects/science">science</a> teachers (particularly <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a>) and is likely equipped with all the essentials for the science teachers to keep them going through their remaining lessons - coffee machine, mini fridge, and a copy that week's newspaper puzzles.</p>
