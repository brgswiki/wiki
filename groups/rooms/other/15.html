<h2>Room 15</h2>
<p>Mrs Baines' office - made up of various smaller rooms. Some students have spent a considerably greater time here than others, finding it the perfect refuge from uneventful lessons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There seems to be no in between, you either never been to the nurse's office (or only gone once or twice), or found yourself taking a quick vacation there several times a day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite being the nurse's office, it is often empty and locked most days and many voyages there end in failure as a result.</p>
