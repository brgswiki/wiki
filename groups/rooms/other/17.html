<h2>General Office</h2>

<p>The General Office is located next to the Main Entrance, and is your one-stop shop for whiteboard markers and purple pens. Also the place you go to hand in any letters when you can't be bothered handing it in to the specific member of staff.</p>
<p>If you arrive late (after 8:40 normally) you need to sign in at the General Office with a reason why you are late, more often than not the ever-reliable buses are to blame for this event.&nbsp;</p>
