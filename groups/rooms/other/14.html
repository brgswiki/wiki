<h2>Room 14</h2>
<p>Unknown to students and the majority of teachers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wedged between <a href="/groups/rooms/science/13">Room 13</a> and the staircase to the <a href="/groups/places/balcony">balcony</a>, Room 14 is a science prep room with a vast number of warning stickers on the door to try and deter students from going in - supposedly because it contains harmful chemicals, however the balcony's laptops are stored here, so the <s>amount</s> volume of chemicals in this room is debated.</p>
<p>More likely, it is the lab technician's hideout (alongside <a href="/groups/rooms/other/6">Room 6</a>) where they are harbouring plans for world domination.&nbsp;</p>
