<h2>E110</h2>
<p>E110 is the English computer room where you can research Englishy (is that a word!?) things for your classes. Itâ€™s also used by a range of other subjects when they need a computer room. KS3 students may sometimes find themselves dumped in here some English lesson, as GCSE students get priority to a choice of classrooms.</p>
