<h2>Room 38</h2>
<p>This room was mostly used by <a href="/teachers/past/mr-fitton">Mr Fitton</a> as it contains enough computers (at a push) for a technology class, as there are only 20 students per class. It is smaller than the other classrooms in the <a href="/groups/places/basement-corridor">basement corridor</a>, and if you sit in this room you are bound to have your chair tangled in at least 3 other chair legs, making it a struggle to enter and exit the classroom.</p>
<p>It is no longer in much use as the DT workshop has been since taken over by <a href="/teachers/past/mr-grundy">Mr Grundy</a> and provided with laptops. Captain Grundy has since left but the laptops remain in place.</p>
