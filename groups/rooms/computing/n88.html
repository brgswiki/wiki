<h2>Room N88</h2>
<p>Room N88 is a computing classroom, often used by <a href="/teachers/mr-brandwood">Mr Brandwood</a>. It may be one of the only rooms with air conditioning however it never really gets warm and therefore is never in use.</p>
<p>At the back corner of the classroom there is a view of the rest of the school from the window, although this is mostly obscured by the rest of the school's roof and swarms of pigeons and crows. It also acts as one of the best viewpoints to spot snow.</p>
<p>There is also a storage room at the other side of the classroom. In here you can find a number of LEGO boxes and pieces, and sometimes those programming bees you got to use in primary school.</p>
