<h2>Room 28</h2>
<p>Room 28 is a computing classroom which is often taught in by <a href="/teachers/mr-jones">Mr Jones</a>. It has a distinct, repellent smell some days (could be drains or <a href="/subjects/food-tech">food tech</a>). The computers are laid out with computers against 3 walls and another lot in a stretch from the back wall to the front.</p>
