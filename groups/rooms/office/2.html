<h2>Room 2</h2>
<p>Room 2 is <a href="/teachers/mr-chambers">Mr Chambers</a>' office, as he is a Head of Year (<a href="/students/intake17">Year 10</a>). This room is wedged between <a href="/groups/rooms/science/1">Room 1</a> and <a href="/groups/rooms/science/3">Room 3</a>, and has a door to Room 1 for no particular reason, like most of the rooms on the <a href="/groups/places/balcony">balcony</a>.</p>
<h3>The Chambers Of Secrets</h3>
<p>As this room belongs to Mr Chambers, it is dubbed as the Chambers of Secrets. In this room however, you won't find a homicidal snake but rather a number of drawers, files, and filing cabinets - which one may argue is <i>even</i> more scary.</p>
