<p>In the past Room 36 has been an office to <a href="/teachers/other/miss-gauntlett">Miss Gauntlett</a>, <a href="/teachers/past/mrs-cassidy">Mrs Cassidy</a>, and <a href="/teachers/mr-seddon">Mr Seddon</a>. Nowadays, no one is really sure who's office it is as it changes hands so often.</p>
<p>Room 36 is found in the basement corridor and once housed a range of strange and unusual objects. This included a box of tape measures, maps, and a number of other <a href="/subjects/geography">geography</a> related items. Mrs Cassidy once let a couple of students skip her lesson to untangle all the tape measures in this room, which we did a surprisingly good job at considering the tape measures looked like they'd been through a washing machine, a smoothie maker, and possibly a major earthquake.</p>
