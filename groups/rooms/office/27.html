<h2>Room 27</h2>
<p>Room 27 is Mr Whyte's office and conveniently lies next to his classroom, <a href="/groups/rooms/rs/26">Room 26</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Mr Whyte, the PE teachers seem to take advantage of his office and use it as a storage room for the ping pong tables that are occasionally brought out into the hall.</p>
