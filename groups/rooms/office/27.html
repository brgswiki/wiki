<h2>Room 27</h2>
<p>Room 27 is <a href="/teachers/mr-whyte">Mr Whyte</a>'s office and conveniently lies next to his classroom, <a href="/groups/rooms/rs/26">Room 26</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Mr Whyte, the <a href="/subjects/pe">PE</a> teachers seem to take advantage of his office and use it as a storage room for the ping pong tables that are occasionally brought out into the hall.</p>
