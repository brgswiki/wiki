<p>This was <a href="/teachers/past/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a>' office, like <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a>' office, is rarely seen by students - although is still more widely known than <a href="/groups/rooms/office/19">Room 19</a> as you can see it from the hall &amp; as you are walking out of the main entrance. It is now Mr Johnstone's office, who has only tweaked a bit of the internal décor - this includes adding a ‘meeting in progress’ sign to the door (and not removing it even when he isn't in) and a black cloak hung up on the cupboards, perhaps a subtle hint at Mr Johnstone's crime fighting alter ego.</p>
<h3>The Contents</h3>
<p>There are many things in this room, both usual and not so usual, this includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A lot of plastic cups</li>
  <li>A number of posters and leaflets on the walls, mostly to do with mental health</li>
  <li>Some (quite nice) antique cupboards, and a secret room hidden next to it (likely a passageway to Mr P's office)</li>
  <li>Some more plastic cups</li>
  <li>Boxes labelled 'sherry glasses', these were outside his office on Parents' Evening...</li>
  <li>A whiteboard, even though there are no classes in here</li>
  <li>A round table in the middle, supposedly for the Staff of the Round Table Meetings</li>
  <li>A few more stacks of plastic cups</li>
  <li>Some jugs of squash &amp; a tea pot</li>
</ul>
