<p>This is <a href="/teachers/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a>' office, like <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a>' office, is rarely seen by students - although is still more widely known than <a href="/groups/rooms/office/19">Room 19</a> as you can see it from the hall &amp; as you are walking out of the main entrance.</p>
<h3>The Contents</h3>
<p>There are many things in this room, both normal and unusual, this includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A lot of plastic cups</li>
  <li>A number of posters and leaflets on the walls, mostly to do with mental health</li>
  <li>Some (very nice if I may say so) antique cupboards, with one part just going really far back for no particular reason</li>
  <li>Some more plastic cups</li>
  <li>Boxes labelled 'sherry glasses', these were outside his office on Parents' Evening...</li>
  <li>A whiteboard, even though there are no classes in here</li>
  <li>A round table in the middle, supposedly for the Staff of the Round Table Meetings</li>
  <li>A few more stacks of plastic cups</li>
  <li>Some jugs of squash &amp; a tea pot</li>
</ul>
