<h2>Headmaster's Office</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right image_resized" style="width:38.63%;"><img src="/room_19.png">
  <figcaption>One of the only sightings of this widely unseen room</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This room is <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a>' office and therefore is little seen by students unless they are particularly gifted or happen to get a lot of penalty points. This room has a combination of older decoration - including paintings and antique furniture, and more modern acquisitions such as a glass table and various bits of tech such as a personal printer.</p>
<h3>Sightings</h3>
<p>Room 19, as mentioned before, is rarely seen by students. It is the location where "High Tea with Mr P" takes place and where the video 'The Headmaster's Office' was filmed. However, this video has since been taken down as BRGSTube thought their videos were being memed too much, fortunately rare bits of the videos still remain across various platforms but sightings of his office are becoming more precious than gold as student's observations of the room had been much like those made of Pluto - black and white, blurred and grainy. Though imperfect, our knowledge of this mysterious place was extrapolated by staff hearsay, and guesswork.</p>
<p>This room is rumoured to contain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A secret door, likely to <a href="/teachers/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a>' office</li>
  <li>A fireman's pole, so Mr Porteous can slide down to the staffroom in style to help himself to the Kenco instant coffee and the staff's stash of digestives</li>
  <li>A time machine, as enforced by the various antiquities in his office&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
