<h2>Room 39</h2>
<p>Room 39 is a <a href="/subjects/food-tech">food tech</a> theory room, previously a DT theory room and therefore kitted out with computers along the walls. Unfortunately there are never enough computers for everyone and you rarely get to sit with your friends. There is also a random pillar in the middle of this room with various graffiti from other bored students.</p>
<p>Along the wall there are a number of posters of types of beef and sweetcorn. There is a sink or two at the front of the classroom and also an oven for practical demonstrations. On the wall at the front near the whiteboard there is a red splash of paint (we hope).</p>
<p>The floor is made of some strange material that means whenever people move their chair in or out from underneath the desks you can hear a loud scraping noise which is <i>much</i> worse than nails on a blackboard.</p>
