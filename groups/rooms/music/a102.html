<h2>A102</h2>
<p>A102 is the music practical classroom where classes learn how to play instruments (as appose to Cubase in <a href="/groups/rooms/music/51">Room 51</a>). In here you can find 15 keyboards, a piano, guitars, about 30 ukuleles, drums, dual screen computers and much much more. I think pretty much everyone in the school loves this room, apart from any art teacher whom is teaching in <a href="/groups/rooms/art/a02">A02</a>. It's often a heavily fought after room so one day you may come to a lesson expecting to be here, only to find that <a href="/teachers/mr-mercer">Mr Mercer</a> had decided the <a href="/students/intake20">Y7s</a> should go in instead, with you being stuck in room 51.</p>
