<h2>Room 51</h2>
<p>Room 51 is a music tech (and often theory) classroom in which you learn what Cubase is and get thrown in there if someone else wants to use the other, more fought after music classroom, <a href="/groups/rooms/art/a102">A102</a>. This then means that contrary to its main purpose (a place for <a href="/teachers/mr-davenport">Mr Davenport</a> to teach music tech) you could find yourself and your class in here in any music lesson. The geography teachers in <a href="/groups/rooms/geography/54">Room 54</a> and <a href="/groups/rooms/geography/55">55</a> hate this room (as with the art teachers with A102) as they can almost always hear an octobass or hornucopian dronepipe screaming out of the Cubase computers (don't worry, we don't know what they are either - but we assure you, they are real instruments).</p>
