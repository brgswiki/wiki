<h2>A02</h2>
<p>A02 is an art classroom directly below <a href="/groups/rooms/art/a102">A102</a>. This is unfortunate for whatever teacher is in here, as you can almost always hear some terrible sounds (apparently music?!) coming from Mr Mercer/ Mr Webber's lessons. There are 15 (ish) computers in the rooms, with desks in the center and a teacher's desk and computer at the front.</p>
