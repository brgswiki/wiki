<h2>A102</h2>
<p>A102 is a <a href="/subjects/music">music</a> classroom which architects decided should be in the art block just to keep <a href="/students/intake20">Year 7</a> students on their toes. This is normally the music theory classroom out of the two, containing a multitude of keyboards, guitars, ukuleles and drums - all the tools you need to annoy the poor art teacher downstairs in <a href="/groups/rooms/art/a02">A02</a> to madness. There's also a piano in here which is perfect for <a href="/teachers/mr-webber">Mr Webber</a> to show off his piano skills to unsuspecting lower school students. After school, music clubs such as concert band and choir are often held in here.</p>
