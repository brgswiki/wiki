<h2>Room A101</h2>
<p>This is <a href="/teachers/mrs-bamford">Mrs Bamford</a>'s <a href="/subjects/art">art</a> classroom, perhaps the nicest room in school with its wall to wall windows and the best views of Waterfoot, or so she likes to claim. This windowed corner is also home to (one of?) the resident skeleton, sometimes seen dabbing, flossing, or returned back to its original standing position by a sharp eyed art teacher. There is also a storage cupboard linked to this classroom that is home to a number of kettles, irons, assorted bones, and various instruments - perhaps stolen from the next door music department in dire times for the art department budget?</p>
<p>Once this classroom was first built, there seemed to be a critical flaw in its design - there was only one sink! Clearly the designers were yet to experience 30 students trying to clean a paint palette <i>after </i>the bell has already gone since no one has kept track of time. A second sink was purchased and left on the floor for a couple of months before the school realised a second step was necessary to make it actually functional.</p>
