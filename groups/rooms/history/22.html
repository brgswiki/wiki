<p>Room 22 is an extremely cramped history and PSCHE classroom. It seems likely that BRGS' original builders and architects made Rooms 23 to 26 and then realised they'd gotten the dimensions slightly off and decided to just cram another classroom in the remaining space. <a href="/teachers/past/mrs-appleton-why">Mrs Appleton-Why</a> teaches a lot in this room.</p>
