<p>Room 32 is a jack of all trades, being used currently as a history, PSHCE, and Spanish classroom. Last year it was also used as a storage room for housing all the art supplies whilst the new art/music block was being constructed.</p>
<p>It seems to be a filler classroom for whenever BRGS is short or need a room change.</p>
