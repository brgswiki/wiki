<p>Room 33 is possibly the most Russian <a href="/subjects/history">history</a> classroom you have ever set foot in, as <a href="/teachers/mrs-grehan">Mrs Grehan</a> has adorned the walls with Putin t-shirts, Putin badges, and in the cupboards you can even find a Putin mug. Similarly, near the door there is a little sign that says something along the lines of 'you are now leaving Russian territory'.</p>
