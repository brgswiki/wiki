<p>Room 23 is a history classroom in the hall. Most of the time the lights are off in here and it is wondered whether any classes are actually taught in here. If you have ever set foot in this room, it is more than likely this was a result of a room change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Room 23 used to be a staffroom before the teachers migrated back to the basement corridor.</p>
