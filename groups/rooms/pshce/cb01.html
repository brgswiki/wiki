<p>CBO3 is possibly one of the nicest rooms in school, probably because isn't intended for use as a classroom but rather a meeting room, hence the moving touchscreen board, carpet, coffee machine, decent cupboards, <strong>actual padded soft chairs</strong>, mini kitchen, and an actually decent temperature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This room was used as a music equipment storage room whilst the art/music block was being built. It was also used for form photographs in 2016, whilst the rest of the form would be cramped in the neighbouring CB01. It is also used by the PTA or any other meetings taking place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last few years, its high standard has fallen and it has been used a PSHCE room, and therefore any classes who have been in here will remember it for being able to watch films to an almost cinema quality.</p>
