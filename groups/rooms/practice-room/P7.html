<h2>Practice Room 7</h2>
<p>Practice Room 7 is a music practice room that is used during music lessons for you to break off into small groups and practice your ‘music’ or make mini bands. This room is located just outside the step leading down to A102, which people often forget is there, so if you ever see a figure fall past the window in the door, then you know why.</p>
