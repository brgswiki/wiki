<h2>Practice Room 1</h2>
<p>Practice Room 1 is a music practice room that is used during music lessons for you to break off into small groups and practice your ‘music’. It offers a lovely view over the art courtyard and is above <a href="/groups/rooms/geography/56">Room 56</a>, making any unlucky <a href="/subjects/geography">Geography</a> Teacher in there want to come and personally strangle anybody using the practice room.</p>
