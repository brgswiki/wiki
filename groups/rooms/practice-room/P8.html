<h2>Practice Room 8</h2>
<p>Practice Room 1 is a music practice room that is used during music lessons for you to break off into small groups and practice your ‘music’. This is also where <a href="/teachers/mr-davenport">Mr Davenport</a> and co. will sit to press buttons when GCSE students are recording themselves. As the music teachers are very protective of these buttons, they will seldom allow badly behaved students in this room. It also has a big glass screen looking into A102.</p>
