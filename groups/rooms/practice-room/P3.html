<h2>Practice Room 3</h2>
<p>Practice Room 3 is a music practice room that is used during music lessons for you to break off into small groups and practice your ‘music’. It offers a lovely view over the art courtyard and if the light is right, you can see into a bunch of other classrooms on the other side of the courtyard.</p>
