<h2>Practice Room 5</h2>
<p>Practice room 5 is a music practice room that is used during music lessons for you to break off into small groups and practice your ‘music’. On Wednesday afternoons and all day on Fridays, <a href="/teachers/music/mr-brown">Mr Brown</a> teaches private Brass and Theory Lessons in here. It offers a great view over the art courtyard to laugh at the poor kids the art teachers have made stand outside in the cold, so they can finish off their coffee. It is also above <a href="/groups/rooms/geography/56">Room 56</a>, making any unlucky <a href="/subjects/geography">Geography</a> Teacher in there hate anybody using the practice room.</p>
