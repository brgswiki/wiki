<h2>Practice Room 9</h2>
<p>Practice Room 9 is a music practice room that is used during music lessons for you to break off into small groups and practice your ‘music’. To make up for the fact this is one of the largest practice rooms, the music department decided to use this one as a dumping ground for all the music stands.</p>
