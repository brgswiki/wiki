<h2>Practice Room 4</h2>
<p>Practice room 4 is a music practice room that is used during music lessons for you to break off into small groups and practice your ‘music’. <a href="/teachers/music/mr-hoyle">Mr Hoyle</a> teaches private string lessons in here, making it infamous for the awful screeches coming from his sub-grade 1 players. It offers a great spying view over the <a href="/groups/places/planopy">canopy</a> to see what the dinner ladies are doing at that moment in time. As with most of the practice rooms, it is also above <a href="/groups/rooms/geography/56">Room 56</a>, making any unlucky <a href="/subjects/geography">Geography</a> Teacher in there hate anybody using the practice room.</p>
