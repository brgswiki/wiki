<h2>Practice Room 6</h2>
<p>Practice Room 6 is a music practice room that is used during music lessons for you to break off into small groups and practice your ‘music’. It offers a lovely view over the <a href="/groups/places/planopy">canopy</a> and, from a certain angle, the lower school dining hall. &nbsp;As with most practice rooms, it is above <a href="/groups/rooms/geography/56">Room 56</a>, making any unlucky <a href="/subjects/geography">Geography</a> Teacher in there want to come and personally strangle anybody using the room. The room also offers a ‘secret’ fire door escape route to the courtyard by the canopy. Pre-covid, you had to be a special music student to have been on the staircase, but now, anybody with a music lesson (except <a href="/students/intake17">Year 10</a>) can use this entrance/exit. Only on these stairs can you fully appreciate the actual number of balls on the roof of the canopy.</p>
