<p>Room 94 is Mrs Fowler-Gibbs'/Mrs Workman's drama room. It is also used for PHSCE by Mrs Richardson and Mrs Taylor. It has fold up tables that are against the walls and chairs in a semi-circle around the classroom. It underwent redecoration over the 2019 summer holidays, although from what most can see this just meant upgrading Mrs Fowler-Gibbs' plastic chair to a spinny chair. In the drawers of the desk there is a small red plastic frog and no one knows why. Be careful near the windows, they once fell out and almost hit somebody and surprisingly Mrs Fowler-Gibbs just started laughing. During KS3 Drama lessons, try and use the corridor outside so you have space to practise, and Mrs Fowler-Gibbs won't constantly nag you about whatever script you're making. This means your performance may actually end up decent, although no guarantees.</p><p>The SFG has also enforced a no drinking area in Room 94. This used to be "water bottles on windowsills/under chairs" then "no drinking in Room 94" until 'drinking vessels' were banned entirely.</p><figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brgs/images/e/e2/Room_94.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20200510114846"></figure><h3>Seating Plan</h3><p>Depending on your teacher or year group, you may be told to sit in "height order" or "house number order" although once you reach year 9 this usually stops and you can just sit where you want.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
