<h2>Practice Room 2</h2>
<p>Practice room 1 is a music practice room that is used during music lessons for you to break off into small groups and practice your ‘music’. On Monday afternoon, all day Wednesday and Thursday afternoons, <a href="/teachers/music/mrs-spall">Mrs Spall </a>teaches private Piano and Woodwind Lessons in here. It offers a great spying view over the <a href="/groups/places/planopy">canopy</a> to see what the dinner ladies are doing at that moment in time. It is also above <a href="/groups/rooms/geography/56">Room 56</a>, making any unlucky <a href="/subjects/geography">Geography</a> Teacher in there hate anybody using the practice room.</p>
