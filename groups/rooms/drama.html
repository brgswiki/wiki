<p>There are 2 main <a href="/subjects/drama">drama</a> classrooms, one for KS3 and one for KS4 / KS5 and some lucky <a href="/students/intake17">Year 9</a> classes who get Mr Neve rather than <a href="/teachers/past/mrs-fowler-gibbs">Mrs Fowler-Gibbs</a>/Mrs Workman for their drama lessons.</p>
<p>The actual drama classroom in the Clark Building has the full works with stage lights, costume cupboard, curtains, a stage, theatre posters etc. <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/en/groups/rooms/drama/94">Room 94</a> however is much less glamorous and has one short of 30 chairs that were probably stolen from a skip, 6 folding tables that stab you in the back when you try to sit down, and a couple of cupboards that may have been made by Year 7s in Design Technology.</p>
