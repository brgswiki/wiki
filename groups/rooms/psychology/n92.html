<h2>Room 92</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/room-92.png"></figure>
<p>Room 92 is a psychology room and therefore lower school students are unlikely to have been in here. It is in the Newchurch Wing (6th form centre) which is suggested as its name is N92.</p>
<p>Curiously, on the school floor-plan there is in fact no visible entrance to it! It is possible the designers just assumed BRGS students would throw themselves through the window to get in, or perhaps there is a secret entrance to Room 92 that us students are unaware of.</p>
