## List of Rooms

BRGS has many rooms, including classrooms and little storage rooms that look like someone hasn't set foot in there since the 1960s (both the storage rooms and the classrooms).
Many of these rooms, depending on the building they reside in, are either miles above or below the ideal temperature.
