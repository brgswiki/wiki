<h2>Miss Jones</h2>
<p>Miss Jones was a trainee <a href="/subjects/history">history</a> teacher in the the 2016/17 school year, kindly putting <a href="/students/intake20">Year 7</a> classes out of their misery after suffering classes with &nbsp;with her fun approach to teaching.</p>
<p>She also did a Christmas history quiz for her classes and the prizes included a broccoli, packets of noodles, and a pineapple. You knew if anyone had won a round because you'd see them walking around school the rest of the day with various shopping list items.</p>
