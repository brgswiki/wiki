<h2>Mr Wilbraham</h2>
<p>Mr Wilbraham is a maths teacher who has been teaching at the school possibly since before the school itself was built. He is also a Countdown addict in fact appearing on the television show itself on Thursday 6th February, 1997, during its 34th season, and attained a score of 45 points. Wilbo was unfortunately defeated by his opponent and did not appear on the show a second time. The word which caught him out was in fact 'microwave'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In maths, you can sometimes hear him shouting resulting in a lot of the other maths teachers telling their class to be quiet so they can see what Wilbo is shouting about now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wilbers has many loves of his life (not just Countdown) this includes Littleborough, the average test score of a class, and football.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, having so many affinities also comes with dislikes - these include hoodies, garlic, geese, people who cannot sit on their chairs properly, This Morning, and cows.</p>
