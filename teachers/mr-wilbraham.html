<p>Mr Wilbraham is a maths teacher who has been teaching at the school possibly since before the school itself was built. He is also a Countdown addict in fact appearing on the television show itself on Thursday 6th February, 1997, during its 34th season, and attained a score of 45 points. Wilbo was unfortunately defeated by his opponent and did not appear on the show a second time. The word which caught him out was in fact 'microwave'.&nbsp;</p><p>In maths, you can sometimes hear him shouting resulting in a lot of the other maths teachers telling their class to be quiet so they can see what Wilbo is shouting about now. He also has all the "Class from Hell" videos on DVD.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:22.89%;"><img src="/mr-wilbraham.png"><figcaption>Wilbo Baggins</figcaption></figure><p>Wilbers has many loves of his life (not just Countdown) this includes Littleborough and football.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, having so many affinities also comes with dislikes - these include hoodies, geese, people who cannot sit on their chairs properly, This Morning, and cows.</p><figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:23.11%;"><img src="/mr-wilbraham-child.jpg"><figcaption>Mr Wilbraham as a child</figcaption></figure><h3>Nicknames</h3><p>Of course Mr Wilbraham sports a number of nicknames, including the well-loved Wilbo.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Wilbo</li><li>Wilbo Baggins</li><li>Wilbers</li></ul><h3>Quotes</h3><blockquote><p>(Singing) "Being a Smurf is good so that's why we sing all day.
