<h2>Mr Wilbraham</h2>
<p>Mr Wilbraham is a maths teacher who has been teaching at the school possibly since before the school itself was built. He is also a Countdown addict in fact appearing on the television show itself on Thursday 6th February, 1997, during its 34th season, and attained a score of 45 points. Wilbo was unfortunately defeated by his opponent and did not appear on the show a second time. The word which caught him out was in fact 'microwave'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In maths, you can sometimes hear him shouting resulting in a lot of the other maths teachers telling their class to be quiet so they can see what Wilbo is shouting about now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wilbers has many loves of his life (not just Countdown) this includes Littleborough, the average test score of a class, and football.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, having so many affinities also comes with dislikes - these include hoodies, garlic, geese, people who cannot sit on their chairs properly, This Morning, and cows.</p>
<p>He is also <a href="/students/intake18/w">18W</a>'s form tutor. (Previously the form tutor of the delightful <a href="/students/intake16/s">16S</a>)</p>
<h3>Going Bananas</h3>
<p>After some student had been leaving bananas around <a href="/groups/rooms/maths/c117">C117</a> and Wilbo consequently hunting down said student to yell at them a few days earlier, Wilbers sits at his desk on the last form time before Christmas to find a banana with a bow on the desk. The remaining 9 students in 16S watch him closely survey the banana before placing it on the far corner of his desk out of sight and doing the register as normal.</p>
<p>Upon being asked what message the banana had written on its side Mr Wilbraham sighed and read out “Dear Mr Wilbraham, I hope this banana has gone mushy. Merry Christmas.” - although he was very happy to see that all the punctuation was correct and would like to congratulate the mysterious banana giver on this feat, clearly being very cynical of the grammatical abilities of us aptly named grammar school students.</p>
