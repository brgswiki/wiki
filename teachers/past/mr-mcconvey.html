<h2>Mr McConvey</h2>
<p>Mr McConvey was a Spanish &amp; French teacher at BRGS. A lot of people from <a href="/students/intake16">Intake 16</a> took Spanish because they thought he was fit and then he left and they got Miss Winchester instead. He was nicknamed 'Dorito' because he was shaped a bit like a triangle. In response to this one particular class people would always bring up doritos and he never understood why. During End of Year Exams he let people airdrop him memes and when he left he gave people all his gaming IDs so they could play games with him.</p>
