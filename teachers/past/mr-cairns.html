<h2>Mr Cairns</h2>
<p>Mr Cairns was originally a technician at BRGS for a number of years, before stepping in as a <a href="/subjects/science">science</a> teacher for lower school. In fact, he loved this role so much he has gone on to study to become a <a href="/subjects/science">chemistry</a> teacher (with <a href="/students/intake18/w">18W</a> as one of his classes however we'll never know how they didn't put him off for life).</p>
<p>He was also a student at BRGS in his youth and fondly remembers days when health and safety was less predominant and him and his classmates flicked liquid mercury at each other (hence the scars in the benches in <a href="/groups/rooms/science/5">Room 5</a> if you look closely enough).</p>
