<h2><strong>Mr Overend</strong></h2>
<p>Mr Overend was a very popular <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> teacher who retired during 2016.</p>
<h3><strong>The Legendary Leavers Day Party</strong></h3>
<p>In the last English lesson of the year for the 05-06 Yr. 11 set, Mr. Overend threw a huge party. This involved loud music, dancing, crowd surfing, and Mr. Overend beaming.</p>
<p>The party, which far surpassed any others going on (such as Mr. Grehans in room 34), was gate-crashed by the majority of Year 11, with even Mr Haycocks' group ditching their sub, Mrs Blow, and joining in the fun.</p>
<p>Oh what a day!</p>
<h3><strong>The Latter Years</strong></h3>
<p>Whilst many elements of Mr O's personality glimmer through from his old days, it's fair to say he had slowed in his age. His final years at BRGS were mainly spent teaching GCSE classes, with the 2012 Intake being his final area of focus.</p>
<p>This year group were notoriously badly behaved and most of Mr Overend's English lessons were spent messing about. He taught Youtuber Millie T who along with a few others, stole a projector remote and would continue to freeze the screen, turn it off, or zoom in, who should have learned from his previous classes. As most class members spent the lesson staring at their phone, some of us realised that sending a clickbait video that would loudly play sex noises to the group chat would be great fun. This resulted in the odd burst of sexual moans from a corner of the classroom amid a struggle to turn off the video. Needless to say Mr Overend was not pleased.</p>
<p>Mr Overend was also quite easy to confuse during this time. On two seperate occasions his class managed to avoid half of the planned lesson. On one occasion the class stood out of view of the doorway in a small crowd in near silence, Mr O did not seem to notice that the majority of his class were so late to his class. On another occasion the class arrived early from a previous lesson and was all present before he had arrived. One student, Nathan, realised that the door handle was broken on the outside and took it off and let the door shut, effectively locking the classroom from the outside. This delayed the lesson significantly.</p>
<p>When the class discovered he was retiring they threw him a party. He seemed happy about this.</p>
