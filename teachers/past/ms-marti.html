<h2>Ms Marti</h2>
<p>Ms Marti was a brilliantly eccentric and lovely German teacher who is actually Swiss. She left at the end of the 2020/21 year. Many of her classes were surprised when she left, as she had told very few she was leaving. Although she only taught German, it is possible she speaks every other language known to man (and many more). This was proven during one Spanish lesson we had when she came in and rather than speaking in English to <a href="/teachers/past/miss-winchester">Miss Winchester</a> they decided to converse in French as we didn't take it. They continued like this for about half the lesson, a lot of which sounded like mocking our class but we'll never know.</p>
<p>She had originally planned to be a translator (maybe explaining her insane knowledge of foreign languages) but soon got bored and decided to teach instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the lockdown (terrorist drill not corona) she sat behind the door and did yoga, whilst our class was painfully stuck in silence under the worst table design. If you have her for German you'll likely get achievement points for simply breathing, even if you aren't in that day. She is also good friends with <a href="/teachers/miss-morris">Miss Morris</a> and <a href="/teachers/mrs-porteous">Mrs Porteous</a>.</p>
<p>Likes: Cats, yoga, knitting, books, Rammstein, manga, and Studio Ghibli (but then again, who doesn't?)</p>

<p>Ms Marti is the inventor of Grammar King, the much-loved little monster who resided on any PowerPoint slides that give grammar tips. Grammar King would watch over Ms Marti's German lessons from above the whiteboard, as it was made into a felted toy. It is possible that there is a whole chain of merchandise coming out from t-shirts to badges to shower curtains. Grammar King was once kidnapped by some students and took him home to show him around then brought him back to the oblivious Ms Marti the next day. She was also the introducer of Kuchendonnerstag (or whichever day you'd have German with her).</p>
<p>As well as this, Ms Marti entrusted one form to keep the Grammar King in their form room when she didn't need it and we did so right until the end of the year when we found out she was leaving (via a Google Meet assembly) and one (very lucky) student kept it over the summer before giving it to Mrs Bowdler (a Spanish and German teacher) the next year who has now done something with it (we don't know).</p>
