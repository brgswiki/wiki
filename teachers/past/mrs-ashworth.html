<p>Mrs Ashworth is an <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> teacher who unfortunately has since left. She was considered one of the nicest and best English teachers.</p>
<h3>The Next Monty Don?</h3>
<p>Mrs Ashworth during her time at school contributed a lot to the gardens and flower beds. In fact, she can still be seen nowadays wandering school with a trowel and gardening gloves as she comes back occasionally to continue gardening. Once she was seen just walking through the Hall with a small tree (not unlike that one scene in Harry Potter where Hagrid just carries the Christmas tree across the courtyard).</p>
<h3>The Phat B*st*rd Story</h3>
<p>One of the stories that <a href="/students/intake16/n">16N</a> can't forget is when Mrs Ashworth told them about the time she needed some new jogging pants. The lovable Mrs Ashworth went into some store with her husband and bought some new track pants from the menswear section. Of course, the poor Mrs Ashworth hadn't checked the pants before buying them, and only after a whole day of wearing them she in fact realised that they said 'phat bastard' across the back!</p>
