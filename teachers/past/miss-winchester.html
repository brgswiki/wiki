<p>Miss Winchester was first a Spanish trainee teacher in 2017/18, training under <a href="/teachers/miss-wilkes">Miss Wilkes</a> (explains a lot, doesn't it?), before she came to BRGS the year later as a full-time Spanish teacher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She took well to the penalty point system and would give people penalty points for rules no other teachers even knew about - in particular the 'no drinking juice during lesson' rule. She also wore a jacket with orange and pink pompoms a lot.</p>
<p>Miss Winchester is now trying out her luck in Spain as an English teacher.</p>
<h3>Ypres Trip 2019</h3>
<p>As Miss Winchester was at the time a <a href="/students/intake16/s">9S</a>'s form tutor, she came along on the Belgium trip for Year 9s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we were all getting on the coaches to set off, a struggling figure could be seen on the horizon with the appearance of coming towards us whilst herding a couple of sheep. As they came closer we could see that this was in fact Miss Winchester carrying not only a suitcase, yet also a whole duvet and two pillows! Not sure if she thought we would be actually <i>sleeping </i>in the trenches.</p>
<p>Throughout the trip she also wore a fluffy fur hat that gave her a very getting-through-Russian-winter look.</p>
<p>At some point in the Belgium trip we found ourselves in a church hall attending a service for BRGS. During this service a woman fell down at the front of the hall and all the way from the back before anyone had registered what had happened, Miss Winchester was running down the aisle (only took a few very large steps as she is pretty tall) to the woman's aid.</p>
