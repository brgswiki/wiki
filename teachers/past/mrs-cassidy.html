<p>The elusive <a href="/subjects/geography">geography</a> teacher and Deputy Head Mrs Cassidy joined BRGS in the 2014/15 school year. She was well known for being one of the most smartly dressed teachers and seemed to have a different blazer for each day of the year.</p>
<h3>A Typical Lesson</h3>
<p>Her lessons mostly comprised of letting around half the students in the class (always the same half) wander around school with a compass and map, or looking for signs of weathering etc. whilst she taught the other half from a textbook and PowerPoint. One time we had to look up the cost of transport on laptops for whatever reason and we ended up reserving spaces on a ferry that left later during that lesson.</p>
<p>Mrs Cassidy may have been one of the only teachers who actually didn't mind when people talked during class and didn't enforce silence during her lessons. She will be missed - although she did say she would make a return to visit <a href="/students/intake16/s">16S</a> during their Speech Night but we are yet to see if she will actually turn up!</p>
<h3>Current Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Mrs Cassidy, clearly believing being Deputy Head of BRGS was not enough, left at the end of the 2016/17 school year and has now gone on to being Headteacher at <a href="https://www.crossleyheath.org.uk/">Crossley Heath Grammar School</a>. This is probably because CHGS is a much nicer school and definitely one ups BRGS' "belfries" as it has its own clock tower and the bannisters have little casts of lions every few inches. CHGS is also in Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the promotion has led to a personality shift and many students at Crossleys complain that she doesn't let teachers put on films before Christmas etc.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Don't worry if Mr Porteous tells you to go to his office. You're not in trouble." (walks away with no explanation)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I quite liked that email you sent me... Oh I'll read it out so the whole class can hear it I just found it so funny. 'Dear Mrs Cassidy, I'm very sorry I couldn't attend the Year 7 Geography Exam Resit yesterday lunchtime. I had just completely forgotten and by the time I remembered I didn't really feel like coming anyway.' I know I should give you a penalty point for not going but you know what, it's fine."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"You guys just get a compass and a sheet and you can fill that in as you walk around school."</p>
