<h2>Mr Chadwick</h2>
<p>Mr Chadwick is one of the all time greats of BRGS. He retired in 2006. He left because his teaching was becoming too good. His finest moment was <a href="/groups/trips/year-9-camp">Year 9 Camp</a> 2005 when he broke his ankle. His mates included Mr Morris OBE, Doc Rob and <a href="/teachers/mr-jackson">Mr Jackson</a>.</p>
