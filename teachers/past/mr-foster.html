<p>Mr Foster was an <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> teacher who joined and left the school in the year 2020/2021 as <a href="/teachers/mrs-szafranski">Mrs Szafranski</a>'s maternity cover after working at Haslingden High School. Little is known about him, except when he reads a chapter which is meant to be frightening, he reads it really intensely, like someone in the room is actually about to die. He seems to memorise certain parts of the book he is reading and make the rest up - whatever you do, don't correct himâ€¦</p>
<p>He was the the only male member of the English department, breaking their long going tradition of at least a number of years. <s>(Excluding </s><a href="/teachers/supply/mr-blacoe"><s>Mr Blacoe</s></a><s>)</s></p>
