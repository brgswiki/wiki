<h2>Ms Rogers</h2>
<p>The woman herself, Ms Rogers, was well known for her amusing criticism of students' artwork and being somewhat racist and defending it with 'having taught across the world', being Spanish, and having a Muslim dad. Her Instagram account was later found by students and it had some... questionable images of her smoking.</p>
<h3>The Art Department Civil War</h3>
<p>She and <a href="/teachers/mrs-bamford">Mrs Bamford</a> had a rivalry which mainly involved lowkey insulting each other during lesson. This includes Ms Rogers referring to Mrs Bamford as "the Head of Art" and never by her real name, possibly afraid it may summon her, and Mrs Bamford saying "you may have had a <i>certain</i> teacher in past years who taught you to do this... well she taught you wrong."</p>
