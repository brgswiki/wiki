<h2>Mrs Khan</h2>
<p>Mrs Khan was a maths teacher who left at the end of the 2016/17 school year. She would let her classes talk but if the lesson was period 2 or 3 then any time we spent talking would be added onto the end of the lesson and taken out of break/lunch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She constantly played a radio station that always seemed to play 'Rockabye' on repeat and not a single other song. Each time I hear that song I am instantly transported back to maths with Mrs Khan in Room C012.</p>
