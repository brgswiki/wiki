<h2><strong>Dr Kirk</strong></h2>
<p>Dr Kirk was a science teacher briefly employed during the first year of <a href="/students/intake-12">Intake 12</a>'s GCSEs. He was mainly tasked with teaching the group of students forming Mr Bretherton's GCSE class after Mr Bretherton had taken sick leave. His heavy Scottish accent and lack of control over lessons made him a favourite for Year 10s who wanted to mess about.</p>
<p>He mainly taught in <a href="/groups/rooms/science/5">Room 5</a></p>
<h3><strong>Teaching Methods</strong></h3>
<p>Classes soon found out that Dr Kirk was very bad at actually enforcing any form of punishment for misbehaving in his lessons. He would usually tolerate a slight bit of talking before shouting at the task or threatening to hold them back at lunch. This never actually came to fruition however</p>
<p>The only time that Kirk, or 'Kirky' as he was referred to gained any sort of foothold over one class was with the help of a certain <a href="/teachers/mr-chambers">Mr Chambers</a>. During a particularly rambunctious practical, it was discovered by Year 10 student Bryce Johnstone that someone had filled his blazer pocket with hand soap whilst he was unaware. After threatening the class to no avail, Dr Kirk turned to Chambers for assistance. The culprit was soon discovered.</p>
<h3><strong>Practicals</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to occasional filling of peoples pockets with hand soap, GCSE classes under Kirk's 'reign' found as many ways as possible to mess about during their practicals. This included but was not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Someone pouring too much acid into a test tube so that it covered the desk and everyones work</li>
  <li>Setting fire to random things on the bunsen burner</li>
  <li>Placing a reactive metal strip inside a sealed container of acid causing the lid to fire off whilst Dr Kirk was explaining something</li>
</ul>
<p>Students in this GCSE class were also kept under a strict seating plan, which could usually be used to waste 5 minutes of the start of the lesson by 'forgetting' where everyone sat. This was due to certain individuals throwing pencils towards the front of the classroom and chunks of gluestick on to the ceiling.</p>
<p>Dr Kirk was also fondly remembered by this class for sending them off on their last lesson with a 'mega practical' which basically consisted of him finding as many ways to educationally blow things up or set things on fire. This was considered to be the greatest moment in his BRGS career as in weeks previous he had simply placed a large jar of maple syrup over a bunsen burner to demonstrate convection currents.</p>
