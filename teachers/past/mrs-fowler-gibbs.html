<h2>Mrs Fowler-Gibbs</h2>
<p>Mrs Fowler-Gibbs is a very eccentric drama teacher who teaches every Year 7 and 8 class drama, and half of the Year 9 classes, whom she shares with Mr Neve. At the end of 2019 she and her family moved to Canada, however she decided to stay until the end of the school year to finish teaching her sixth formers. At the Christmas assembly she requested to have a poem read out but it was all about suncream.</p>
<h3>A typical lesson with the SFG:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mrs Fowler-Gibbs often spends at least 10 minutes trying to get Year 7s and 8s into a seating plan that often revolves around height or the alphabet. (Year 9s avoid this as Mrs Fowler-Gibbs just lets you sit wherever you want, but the 10 minutes is usually also used up as she spends so long telling you to shut up.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Once she has managed this (getting year 7s to do this is like herding kittens) she does the register then explains what you should be doing in the lesson. This takes around 15 minutes give or take.</li>
  <li>Then she'll put you in groups, and she has an uncanny ability to put people in groups with people they don't work well with. Maybe she has an affinity for Year 9s, but often she lets them work with whoever they want and surprisingly this ends up with better performances.</li>
  <li>After putting people in groups she proceeds to explain the plan lesson all over again despite everyone already knowing what they need to do. Sometimes she even repeats the instructions a 3rd time.</li>
  <li>This usually leaves around 10 minutes for you to make a script, practise it, remember it, get everyone to perform it, and then get your results back.</li>
  <li>The above never works and usually means you get 4 minutes max to make a performance and then the remaining time is used to perform it, which usually carries over into the next lesson.</li>
  <li>Warning: If she doesn't like you, no matter how good an actor you may be, be prepared to get a lot of tins or Razzies. If this is the case, seize the opportunity to use your powers for good and make all your performances as bad as possible - she doesn't appreciate it but what else are you supposed to do?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lockdown Drill Memories</h3>
<p>One class will never forget the one lockdown drill in which they were in a lesson with Mrs Fowler-Gibbs. As if being locked in a classroom was not enough, one student discovered a spider in the room. Of course this sent the class into a pandemonium rather than the intended silence and so this resulted in the SFG getting very cross indeed, so she got up, stamped on the spider and then gave half the class a penalty point.</p>
