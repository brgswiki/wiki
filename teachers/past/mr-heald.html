<h2>Mr Heald</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/mr_heald.png"></figure>
<p>Mr Heald was a <a href="/subjects/physics">Physics</a> teacher that joined in 2019 and left us in 2021 to go and teach in Dubai. His fun lessons managed to make even the most boring physics topics sound vaguely interesting. This is probably helped by him always telling at least one interesting story a lesson. These have included; a German cannibal, a girl who did drugs and then drank so much that she died and someone from his school that went on a Spanish exchange and had an appendicitis then died.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During lockdown, like many people, he shaved his head, and not like many people, got two kittens. These cats are rumored to be the true <a href="/subjects/physics/physics-cat">Physics Cats</a> that <a href="/groups/rooms/science/7">Room 7</a> is a shrine to and even featured in a Year 8 physics booklet later that year.</p>
<p>When it was his birthday his form made him a bunch of Obama prisms and he his them all around the staffroom, and various other science classrooms. There is still one in <a href="/groups/rooms/science/9">Room 9</a> on top of the cupboards. He also sometimes did raffles where you could win chocolate and other treats (to eat, or to deal on the black market - his words not mine).&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was supposedly the staffroom's in-house DJ, so he must be sorely missed by all the teacher fans of Bob Marley and Rick Astley. He is also apparently the same height as he was when he was 14.</p>
<h3>Bowties</h3>
<p>On Fridays, Mr Heald would wear a bow tie - he called this bow tie Fridays. Although he loved bow ties, he kept to this tradition because "Wearing a bow tie everyday is too extravagant" . Apparently, his dog has also worn a bow tie in the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In Mr Porteous's own words "He will be remembered for his efforts to bring bow ties back in fashion. Efforts I think have been very successful!"&nbsp;</p>
<h3>His (second) Haircut</h3>
<p>As fellow <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> department members have described it…</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Imagine an egg in a bow tie."</li>
  <li>Or more simply… “Megamind.”</li>
</ul>
