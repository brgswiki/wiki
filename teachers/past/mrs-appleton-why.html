<p>Mrs Appleton-Why or Appleby is a short and sassy history teacher. She used to have long hair then she had short hair then she bleached it. She has a son but didn't want to put him on her family tree so instead used her goldfish, Goldy. She dislikes it if you talk in her lesson and is known to put on really grainy history videos that look as though they were actually filmed during the 1600s. She also gives sassy comments and penalty points if you talk in her lesson, which means you are instantly on her dislike list. Fortunately, her lessons mainly consist of videos and maybe a worksheet or two, and then around 10 minutes at the end of the lesson to chat amongst each other 'waiting for the bell to go'</p>
