<h2>Mr Bretherton</h2>
<p>Mr Bretherton first joined BRGS in 2004, before retiring in 2018 but much to students' relief returning part time in 2019. Mr B has also taught at Haslingden High School for a total of 17 years. Over this time he has inspired countless students to study <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a>, from A-Level to beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are deeply saddened to announce that Mr Bretherton unfortunately passed away in 2020 after a long battle with leukaemia, and he is sorely missed by students and staff alike.</p>
<h3>Chemistry</h3>
<p>Mr Bretherton taught physical chemistry to A-Level students (the mathsy topics). Mr Bretherton was a strong believer in the use of ‘sulphur’ rather than ‘sulfur’ and using the correct version would definitely put you in his good books.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>(To a new class of Year 9s) “You'll need your <a href="/other/whiteboard-pens">whiteboard pens</a>… Are we all BRGS ready?”</p>
  <p>(Class panicked as after 2 years at BRGS owning and keeping a whiteboard pen for longer than a few days is an impressive if not impossible feat)</p>
  <p>“No…? Well, there's a box on my desk whilst I'm writing on the board go and get one - just make sure I don't see you or I'll have to give you a penalty point.” (clearly with no intention to give anyone a penalty point)</p>
  <p>(Half the class runs/crawls across the room to get a whiteboard pen whilst Mr B slowly writes out the task on the board)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"If they're not here, I have to mark them as absent." (something of a catchphrase)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Mr B: How did we dispose of the acid last lesson?</p>
  <p>Student: We drank it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Mr B: And we know there is oxygen in the ocean because….? (motions fish swimming with his hands)</p>
  <p>Student: There are submarines?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My initials are JAB because my mother put my name down wrong on my birth certificate by accident.”</p>
