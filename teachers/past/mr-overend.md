# Mr Overend
Mr Overend was a very popular English teacher who retired during 2016.
# The Legendary Leavers Day Party
In the last English lesson of the year for the 05-06 Yr. 11 set, Mr. Overend threw a huge party. This involved loud music, dancing, crowd surfing, and Mr. Overend beaming.

The party, which far surpassed any others going on (such as Mr. Grehans in room 34), was gate-crashed by the majority of Year 11, with even Mr Haycocks' group ditching their sub, Mrs Blow, and joining in the fun.

Oh what a day!

# Scrapes with the law
Being of Irish descent, its fair to say Mr. O likes a few jars. Do the research, free press is a good place to start.

# Things that Mr Overend has done
After we put on my video of Hot Shots in Room 10 while he wasn't looking, the sound came on ridiculously loudly in the class, but not on the white board screen, as the projector wasn't switched on. This caused him to think that one of us was emitting this loud noise about not copying videos, and marched round the room putting his ear next to all of us at the back.

Then, (as trailers for other films started to play), he realised that it was coming from the speakers at the front, and tried to force the DVD player (that wasn't even switched on) open. He then asked for assistance, at which point we denied blankly even being able to hear anything. 5 minutes of searching later, he finally found the source of the noise amongst all of us, and switched it off, saying, "very funny, very funny, well done you got me there..." (he had grown used to this sort of behaviour having had it for 2 years).

Ziggy stole the remote control to the projector in T5, and spent the entire lesson zooming in on the screen and Mr Overend had no idea which of the 15 of us had it.

We found some red ink in the cupboard, (probably during one of the times where we'd hide in the closet until half way through the lessons and then jumping out saying that we had been dueling with Voldemort), and i put loads of the red ink on a tissue and then (clutching them to my face), as Overend entered, ran out yelling that i had been punched in the face and i needed to go wash my nose. 10 easy minutes out of English.

Overend eventually started to take a bit of control after we'd ran out of scripted lines...and begins on a 10 minute explanation about how international the class is and how we should all get on despite our differences!!!!This is where we made the discovery that he is Northern rather than Southern Irish, and used that in future weeks in more distractions.

Mr. Overend has thrown an MP3 player across Room 10, after countless times of music suddenly blaring out from Sheepy's phone, and after having already confiscated the MP3 off me, and after I had stood up and calling him gay, to which he replied,
"GAY!!! YOU'RE THE ONES WHO'RE BEING GAY!!".

In 08R's English lesson, people were repeatedly playing inappropiate music from phones. Eventually he lost it, grabbed the phone off Kieran, threw it across the room and kicked it against the wall, smashing the screen.

In the final English lesson of Year 11 (97 intake), we bought him a 4 pack of Guinness. Mr. Grehan wandered in and said,
"Kevin, can I, erm, drink one?". With the inevitable answer being no, as soon as Kev left, out comes a can, "I'll drink one because I want one".

Mr. Overend has avoided many questions, most likely because he cannot answer them. For example, if you were to ask how the writer's language influences the reader, he would go on to tell you how intelligent and sophisticated the language is, but not how it influences the reader.

# Further things he has done
Whilst having the projector on, a student (from the class from hell 05-06, as mentioned above) typed in 'wanker' on the username so the whole class started laughing. Mr. O turned around just as the person was trying to delete it...not surprisingly, he wasnt too pleased, yet took the accusation quite well by going red in the face and screaming "YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO JUDGE ME!!!!".

A different student from the same class, being quite bored with whatever task had been set, realised how Mr O's name rhymed with other words, and started saying 'Bend Overend, bend Overend haha..', to which Mr O came over, and quietly began to talk to her, before getting exceedingly angry; "I won't have my name being made fun of from people like YOU!" *scrunched up paper that student had absent-mindedly been shredding, and thres it at her.

Whilst sitting in a silent class, a student waved to her friend across the room. Overend saw red: "STOP MAKING STUPID HAND GESTURES ACROSS THE ROOM THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS!!!!!".


# Things that Mr Overend has had to put up with
Sheepy rolling up cigs during the lesson.
Sheepy continually playing Ring of Fire and Freestyler on his phone during the lessons.
Salman listening to his mp3 player every lesson. Earning the nickname, DJ Salman.
Quinny putting forward the suggestion that the main character in every book or poem was in fact, homosexual. To which a few positive responses actually came back.
Quinny also trash talking Americans in every single exam paper, or writing Overend related stories.
Our class deciding it will be fun to pretend we are all wizards and casting spells at each other, and being 10 minutes late to lessons, following Overend up and down the hill looking for us then blaming it all on Voldemort.
Dom running round the class room jumping over chairs and "KAW KAW"ing whilst wearing a large black coat. Taken the mick out of Edgar Allen Poe's Raven.
Continual misquoting from any books/poems read....from anyone. "QUOTH THE RAVEN", "PARAMOUNT.....channel 124" "People ain't people.....they're robots..."
Peter Read. Just.....yeah. He actually did no work. Ever.

Having to put up with being Mad-Eye Overend in Quinny's story.

Momentousskis.com, which just screamed really really loudly when you went on it. We ALL clicked on it once. What a racket.

People leaving class for fake Music Lessons and injuries.

# The Latter Years
All the previous information is sourced from the BRGS Old Wiki. Whilst many elements of Mr O's personality glimmer through from his old days, it's fair to say he had slowed in his age. His final years at BRGS were mainly spent teaching GCSE classes, with the 2012 Intake being his final area of focus. 

This year group were notoriously badly behaved and most of Mr Overend's English lessons were spent messing about. 
He taught Youtuber Millie T who along with a few others, stole a projector remote and would continue to freeze the screen, turn it off, or zoom in, who should have learned from his previous classes.
As most class members spent the lesson staring at their phone, some of us realised that sending a clickbait video that would loudly play sex noises to the group chat would be great fun. This resulted in the odd burst of sexual moans from a corner of the classroom amid a struggle to turn off the video. Needless to say Mr Overend was not pleased.

Mr Overend was also quite easy to confuse during this time. On two seperate occasions his class managed to avoid half of the planned lesson. On one occasion the class stood out of view of the doorway in a small crowd in near silence, Mr O did not seem to notice that the majority of his class were so late to his class.
On another occasion the class arrived early from a previous lesson and was all present before he had arrived. One student, Nathan, realised that the door handle was broken on the outside and took it off and let the door shut, effectively locking the classroom from the outside. This delayed the lesson significantly.

When the class discovered he was retiring they threw him a party. He seemed happy about this.

At this point he stormed out leaving us in silence. A few seconds later a student got up and said in a very gay voice 'and I want silence when i come back.' Unfortunatley Mr O was just coming through the door and saw the unfortunate Pupil standing at then front of the class mimicking him and had another outburst of rage!
