<h2>Miss Bibi</h2>
<p>Miss Bibi is an <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> teacher who both joined and left BRGS during the 2019/20 school year. Unfortunately as she was new a lot of classes took advantage of that and just messed about in lesson, and she was wrong in believing that taking a strict approach would drill respect into them.</p>
