<h2>Mrs Jackson</h2>
<p>Mrs Jackson is a food tech teacher who supposedly left at the end of the 2016/17 school year. It isn't exactly sure if she left or not because she keeps coming back, either to teach food tech to her Year 13s, be one of the exam invigilators, or to just come back and teach food tech anyway.</p>
<p>Notably, she says a mix of 'scon' and 'scoan' and didn't even realise until someone asked which way she really though scone was really pronounced - to which she replied that she didn't even know anymore.</p>

  <p>"You're teenagers, it doesn't really matter what you eat because you use it up whilst growing anyway so go eat pizza or whatever you want."</p>
