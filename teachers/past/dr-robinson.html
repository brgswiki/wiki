<h2>Doc Rob</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/docrob.png"></figure>
<p>Past geography teacher and deputy head from 1990 to 2007.</p>
<p>The following is taken from the old BRGS Wiki</p>
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Born in a distant time, Doctor L. Arthur Robinson (or Doc Rob as most people would have known him), is one of the most under-rated members of staff in the school. Everyone argues that Mr Fuller was one of the greatest teachers to ever live, but Doc Rob is arguably greater.</p>
<p>Despite doing ten times more work than anyone else in the school (and that's not to say other teachers are slackers, but he does everyone's timetables at the start of the year, random assemblies, teaches several classes in both Geography and CT, and is also second in command to Mr Morris), he never looks particularly busy, and often has time to take place in charity events such as hockey matches.</p>
<p>Put quite simply, his knowledge of <a href="/subjects/geography">Geography</a>, or for that matter, ANYTHING, is superior to anyone else alive today. He can successfully give a ten minute lecture on complex <a href="/subjects/chemistry">Chemistry</a> or <a href="/subjects/physics">Physics</a>, perfectly delivered, and then state that his knowledge of these subjects is "pretty poor", despite knowing more than any student (or staff member) he talks to. Also, he is an absolute goldmine in terms of comedy quotes (below), and for all these reasons, and many more besides, he deserves his status as a legend of our time.</p>

<p>His retirement on the 20th July 2007, after seventeen years at BRGS, is a travesty of the modern age, meaning that future generations will never have the privilege of meeting this great man. It says something about his talents that his job is being split between two future candidates, or "mortals" as they are known...</p>
<p>Letters sent out to students still bear his name as a deputy head. This proves either that he is still in the school somewhere, or that the school is becoming less and less organised without him, and they can't even take his name off the letters. It's also possible that it was left there deliberately as a mark of respect, or that it is physically impossible to remove Doc Rob from the school entirely.</p>
<h3>Knowledge</h3>
<p>Dr Robinson has an extremely robust knowledge on the topic of absolutely anything. The one thing that he was found not to know was why there was a '6' in the A2 Geography coursework spreadsheet's Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient formula. Then again, who does?</p>
<p>He is also capable of "repairing" any dodgy electrical item merely by shouting at it. Even non-sentient electrical devices are in awe of Doc Rob's power...</p>

<h3>Weapons of choice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Eye of the Hawk- The amazing ability Doc Rob has to see a undone top button from one side of the canteen to the other, despite the fact said year 7 had his tie done up at the time. This incident inevitably concluded in a spectacular display of 'YOU BOY!' which brought the entire canteen to a standstill until said traumatised year 7 scuttled away behind Doc Rob's striding walk.</li>
  <li>The Voice of God – This is the ability to command anyone to do something and they are unable to resist. Whereas other teachers will walk past you and tell you to tuck your shirt in then walk off, his voice forces you to keep it tucked in all day, and there is nothing you can do about it. Also used to bring the entire canteen (staff included) to a standstill with a mere two words. The voice is also used to blow a whistle before issuing the aforesaid commands.</li>
  <li>The Umbrella of Doom – strictly speaking not a weapon, but a defensive device, it protects him and the honoured 3 or so students ever allowed under it from the rain.</li>
  <li>Time Lord – This explains why he can do so much work, (he has a tardis and so can do it whenever he wants, then go back in time and have it completed after a few seconds), and also his knowledge. His immortality is also a consequence of this, although he is beyond any normal time lord. It is believed that he has come to BRGS to end the extensive building schemes of Lord Morris, a Krillitane.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mistakes</h3>
<p>What? How very dare you! Dr. Robinson does not make mistakes.</p>
<p>(Well, OK, perhaps the one where he was covered in boiling hot geyser water springs to mind...)</p>
<p>(And perhaps whilst trying to make a phone call via mobile telephone for the first time and not realising you had to put it up to his ear so he could hear his wife and for her to hear him)</p>
<h3>Side Notes and other Miscellaneous Legends</h3>
<ul>
  <li>After leaving BRGS, this may slowly cause the entire school to slowly collapse, as the echo of his voice still lingers, the building still stands, as his bellowing voice was the only thing that could command the building not to collapse at any given moment, at the loss of Doc Rob, we may just see the end of the "working" school, as he was most likely the one that stopped Lord Morris creating stupid rules, building ridiculous things, and spending ridiculous amounts of money on useless things, such as a bike shelter (like bikes personally prefer being dry) which will fall down with the slightest bit of wind (try rocking it, it wobbles like jelly)(which also doesn't actually cover ALL of the bike racks by the way) and putting a new HUGE computer suite in the sixth form section, since we had enough computers for the sixth formers anyway, but now, even the rest of the school can't see them, never mind use them.</li>
  <li>Other Causes of the schools downfall due to Doc Rob leaving, is the rumour, that Doc Rob was actually a cyborg, or some kind of computer program, who unbeknownst to anyone else, would integrate himself into the school network, and effectually become part of the wiring, in case that at his removal form the school, the wires would begin to pull the bricks out of the walls.</li>
  <li>The collapse of the schools moral and physical being since Doc Rob left, may also be due to Doc Rob, being the last person to know the original Mr. Morris's plans and vision for the school, whereas now that he has left, Lord Morris, can now turn the school into Fearns, or Haslingden High School. The Horror. Or on a lighter note, a prison for the slightly more intelligent than the rest of the public.</li>
  <li>A one-way system used to exist on both sets of stairs to the balcony after assembly. Doc Rob could generally be seen at the bottom of said stairs, terrorising any poor student who dared try to go the wrong way. Since Doc Rob's depature, the whole school quickly began to descend into chaos after assemblies, and now the amount of year 7's being squashed flat whilst attempting to leave the hall is at a record high.</li>
