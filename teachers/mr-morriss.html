<p>Mr Morriss (pronounced Morris, not Morees or Maurice), is director of sixth form and a <a href="/subjects/biology">biology</a> teacher. He joined BRGS in 1994 and his first impression of the school was 'splendid Victorian architecture'. His interests include playing bass guitar and aerobics.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Fashionista</h3>
<p>Mr Morriss deserves commendation for wearing bright purple shell suit pants on one red nose day. He asked his students to make sure that everybody knows this was only a joke and indeed not what he would wear whilst out with friends... not sure how many would believe him!</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Mr Morriss: Would you like to hear my Red Dwarf impression?</p>
  <p>Class: No... not really...</p>
  <p>Mr Morriss: Well.....</p>
