<p>Mr Morriss (pronounced Morris, not Morees or Maurice), is director of sixth form and a <a href="/subjects/biology">biology</a> teacher. He joined BRGS in 1994 and his first impression of the school was 'splendid Victorian architecture'. His interests allegedly include playing bass guitar and aerobics. His mum is an American citizen.</p>
<h3>The Fashionista</h3>
<p>Mr Morriss deserves commendation for wearing bright purple shell suit pants on one red nose day. He asked his students to make sure that everybody knows this was only a joke and indeed not what he would wear whilst out with friends... not sure how many would believe him…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>”Sat Nav has saved more relationships that marriage counselling… like I’d be driving on a roundabout and take the wrong left and then a number of names would come my way and then the dreaded words would come - ’Why don’t you ask for directions?’”&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr Morriss: Would you like to hear my Red Dwarf impression?</p>
