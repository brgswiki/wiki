<p>Miss Forrest is a Spanish Teacher that joined in 2019. She is quite chill but makes you resit tests and doesn't like it if you talk in her lesson. She likes Spanish omelettes. She was gone for a few weeks due to an operation and Miss Lapiza covered for her. She does not appreciate lost Spanish books, bad presentation, speaking in her lesson or pulling on the blinds. Once her blinds were broken so she emailed the technicians three times and when they finally came they wrapped it in wrapping paper.</p><figure class="image image-style-align-left"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brgs/images/6/6a/Miss_Forrest.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20200510153606"></figure><h3>Quotes</h3><blockquote><p>"Shut up."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"IS HE MAKING FACES OUTSIDE THE DOOR??"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Write down the learning objective in English AND Spanish!"</p><p>"<i>Hola chicos!"</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Once I was just too busy doing something else that I just burnt my soup, like who even knew you could <i><strong>burn soup</strong></i>?"</p></blockquote>
