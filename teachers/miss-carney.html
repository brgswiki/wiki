<h2>Miss Carney</h2>
<p>Miss Carney is a Terry-Pratchett-loving English teacher and is probably (one of) the nicest teacher(s) in the whole school. Like most English teachers, she is quite a radical feminist and we love her for it and will not stand for gender discrimination. Her lessons are chill and enjoyable, and she knows how to really inspire and bring out the best in her students. She is lovely, and the word moist makes her feel sick.</p>
<p>Besties with literally every teacher, including <a href="/teachers/mr-spencer">Mr Spencer</a>.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Miss Carney: I love rules - I love being able to stand at the water fountain telling off students for filling their water bottles.</p>
  <p>Student: But that's so mean!</p>
  <p>Miss Carney: It's funny, especially when they argue back and say that water is a human right because then I just say ‘Well, what about the children in Ukraine?’</p>
  <p>Student: Why? Is someone stood at their water fountains telling them off?</p>
  <p>Miss Carney: Well, they should have filled them at lunch!</p>
  <p>Student: What, the Ukrainians?</p>

  <p>Miss C: Are you a feminist?</p>
  <p>Student: No.</p>
