<h2>Miss Carney</h2>
<p>Miss Carney is a Terry-Pratchett-loving English teacher and is probably the nicest teacher in the whole English department. Like most English teachers, she is quite a radical feminist and will not stand for gender discrimination. Her lessons are chill and enjoyable, and she knows how to really inspire and bring out the best in her students. She is lovely, and the word moist makes her feel sick.</p>
