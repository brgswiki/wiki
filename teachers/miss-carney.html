<h2>Miss Carney</h2>
<p>Miss Carney is a Terry-Pratchett-loving English teacher and is probably (one of) the nicest teacher(s) in the whole school. Like most English teachers, she is quite a radical feminist and we love her for it and will not stand for gender discrimination. Her lessons are chill and enjoyable, and she knows how to really inspire and bring out the best in her students. She is lovely, and the word moist makes her feel sick.</p>
<p>Besties with literally every teacher, including <a href="/teachers/mr-spencer">Mr Spencer</a>.</p>
