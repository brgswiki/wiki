<h2>Miss Foster</h2>
<p>Miss Foster is one of three <a href="/subjects/geography">geography</a> teachers and often teaches in <a href="/groups/rooms/geography/55">Room 55</a>. She joined at the start of the 2017/18 school year to replace <a href="/teachers/past/mrs-cassidy">Mrs Cassidy</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Love Island Fan</h3>
<p>Miss Foster is apparently also no small Love Island fan and in one lesson where we were talking about geography teachers a certain physics teacher once said "Miss Foster? Ohh you mean <i>that</i> Miss Foster, yeah we talk about Love Island in the staffroom sometimes."</p>
<p>Allegedly, another time in the staffroom <a href="/teachers/mrs-porteous">Mrs Porteous</a> and <a href="/teachers/miss-morris">Miss Morris</a> decided to switch the telly to Love Island whilst <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a> was asleep then take a photo and sent it to staffroom group chat to try and trick them, leading Miss Foster to believe Alan was fellow Love Island fan. Apparently she tried talking to him about it and he had no idea what she was on about!</p>
<h3>Coat-hanger Collector</h3>
<p>In the unlikely circumstance that you have seen Miss Foster's car, the first thing you may immediately notice is that there are <i>a lot</i> of coat hangers in it! In her words, she told us that "I'm a geography teacher! I need to be prepared for any situation." I'm unsure of which geography related situation requires 50 odd coat hangers but I'm sure there's a reason.</p>
