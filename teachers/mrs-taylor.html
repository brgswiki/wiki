<h2>Mrs Taylor</h2>
<p>Mrs Taylor is a PSHCE &amp; law teacher, and also runs the mock trial club.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>A Typical Lesson</h3>
<p>Her lessons are pretty fun as - like most PSHCE lessons - involve making posters and watching films. When starting a lesson, she likes to ask a question as she goes through the register such as 'what did you do over the holiday?' or 'what is your favourite food?' or 'which teacher scares you the most?' and then students rather than answering 'good morning/afternoon' will answer the question.</p>
<p>The register is good fun and takes up at least 15 minutes of the lesson. If you ever have the choice at the last lesson of term choose circle time over film! Circle time is so much more fun than a film.</p>
