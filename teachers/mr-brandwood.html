<h2>Mr Brandwood</h2>
<p>Mr Brandwood is a computing teacher who joined last year to replace Mrs Sharp. He does not like it when people look up <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a> memes on school computers during his lessons or when they play kazoo instead of doing the work. He doesn't like be called short either (though he definitely is).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Tie Incident</h3>
<p>One time Room 88 had an unfortunate issue that required Mr Porteous to have to talk to Mr Brandwood. Unfortunately that day Mr Brandwood forgot his tie, and the heroic <a href="/teachers/mr-wilkinson">Mr Wilkinson</a> decided he should step up and help poor Mr Brandwood solve his uniform issue. He did this by cutting out the shape of a tie from a plastic bag and leaving it on Mr Brandwood's desk with a note saying 'I got your back, bro'. Now, on any other day this would have been fine, but Alan chose this day to walk into Mr B's computing lesson and upon seeing the state of his tie he just went 'I'll talk to you later' leaving a very panicked Mr Brandwood.&nbsp;</p>
