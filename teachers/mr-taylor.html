<h2>Mr Taylor</h2>
<p>Mr Taylor is currently a trainee <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> teacher, appearing on a number of physics meets, and therefore becoming a member of the most esteemed department in BRGS. His powerpoints make use of various memes from Baby Yoda to BRGS' very own. Not only is he a fan of physics, memes, and Whiteboard.fi, he is also from Spain (the south specifically).</p>
<p>Having only seen him on Google Meets, many students believe they're not ready to see him in person, believing him to simply already have too powerful vibes on Google Meets that the chaotic energy of real lessons will be too much for them.</p>
<p>His powerpoints start off with a ‘what’s today’s mood’ of various pictures from Star Wars to llamas.</p>
<p>His generosity knows no bounds, as shown after giving out skittles to his classes. He is now off to another school where we wish him the best.</p>
