<h2>Mr Webber</h2>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:21.89%;"><img src="/mr_webber.png"></figure>
<p>Mr Webber is a music teacher who, as far as most can tell, can play any instrument he picks up. Most people, if not all will be taught by him at some point from year 7-9 as there are only two music teachers along with Mr Davenport. He has a peculiar, sarcastic sense of humour and at times can be really fun. Christmas brings out the best in him, especially if he dresses up with a Santa beard and a Christmas jumper at the legendary Christmas concerts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's true that he has a keen interest in philosophy and ethics, and as a result is quite a deep, critical thinker. He’s also a fan of jazz and manages to turn everything into a swag jazz chord or improvisation &nbsp;</p>
