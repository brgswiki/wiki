<h2>Mr Pigott</h2>
<p>Mr Pigott is a PE teacher who was originally named Stacey but then changed it to Martin in attempt to save him much grief. He has also recently taken to playing the guitar and takes music lessons at school. On <a href="/groups/trips/year-9-camp">Year 9 Camp</a> he demonstrated his guitar skills and considerably less skilled 'singing' - more than once!&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the China trip our 60 odd year old instructor beat Mr Pigott on the high jump.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Mr P: Ohh is that badge for harpooning dolphins and eating them?&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Student: Erm no, its an RSPB seal badge.</p>
  <p>Mr P: Oh I thought that was only for birds? I mean if you throw a dolphin off a plane I guess it becomes a bird.</p>
  <p>(Which dolphin hurt him??)</p>

  <p>Mrs Williamson: Sir, do you want the girls to do it?</p>
  <p>Mr P: And what, show the boys how to fail?</p>
  <p>Mrs W: I'm pretty sure the boys know how to fail - they're doing it right now!</p>
