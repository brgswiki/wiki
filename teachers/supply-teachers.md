# Supply Teachers
BRGS has brought in a couple of supply teachers, either on days when a lot of teachers are on a trip or when a teacher is ill and they cover their lessons for a few months.
Luckily many supply teachers don't understand the whole Penalty Point system, and therefore cover lessons with them are usually a doss. If you do anything wrong then it is usually followed up with a menacing "do you want me to sign your planner?!" and then wondering why this has no effect.

> I'm afraid I don't know all the supply teacher's names, either because they never disclosed them or I've just forgotten - hence some of the nicknames. If you know their real name, feel free to replace it!
