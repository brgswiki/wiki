<h2>Mr Chambers</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/mr-chambers.png"></figure>
<p>Mr Chambers is a <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a> teacher and also Head of <a href="/students/intake17">Year 9</a>. He is also pretty good at high jump and beat <a href="/teachers/mr-pigott">Mr Pigott</a>.</p>
<h3>The Chambers of Secrets</h3>
<p>Mr Chamber's office is Room 2 (not surprisingly between <a href="/groups/rooms/science/1">Room 1</a> and <a href="/groups/rooms/science/3">Room 3</a>). Only those lucky enough to set foot inside have seen what store cupboards and files lie in there. For this reason his office is referred to as the 'The Chambers of Secrets'.</p>
