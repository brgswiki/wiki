<h2>Mr Chambers</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/mr-chambers.png"></figure>
<p>Mr Chambers is a <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a> teacher and also Head of <a href="/students/intake17">Year 9</a>. He is also pretty good at high jump and beat <a href="/teachers/mr-pigott">Mr Pigott</a>. One lesson in <a href="/groups/rooms/history/33">Room 33</a>, he didn't have a beaker on hand so he made do with the next best thing - <a href="/teachers/mrs-grehan">Mrs Grehan</a>'s Putin mug. The purpose of this beaker was to store hydrochloric acid. To dispose of it he poured it out of the window.</p>
<h3>The Chambers of Secrets</h3>
<p>Mr Chamber's office is <a href="/groups/rooms/office/2">Room 2</a> (not surprisingly between <a href="/groups/rooms/science/1">Room 1</a> and <a href="/groups/rooms/science/3">Room 3</a>). Only those lucky enough to set foot inside have seen what store cupboards and files lie in there. For this reason his office is referred to as the 'The Chambers of Secrets'.</p>
