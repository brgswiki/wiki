<h2>Mr Bowley</h2>
<p>Mr Bowley is the new Design &amp; Technology teacher as of this year, joining to replace <a href="/teachers/past/mr-grundy">Mr Grundy</a>. We can only hope he is better than the two <a href="/teachers/past/mr-fitton">DT teachers</a> before him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An update: he is yet to discover how to access his emails, we have lost all hope.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“There were a couple of concerns raised about wiping down the keyboards with wet wipes, so I've squeezed all the liquid out of them.”</p>
