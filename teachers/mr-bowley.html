<h2>Mr Bowley</h2>
<p>Mr Bowley was a Design &amp; Technology teacher as of 2021, joining to replace <a href="/teachers/past/mr-grundy">Mr Grundy</a>. He also left in 2021, so couldn't of liked the school much as he only stayed for 2 terms. We could only hope he was better than the two <a href="/teachers/past/mr-fitton">DT teachers</a> before him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An update: he is yet to discover how to access his emails, we have lost all hope.</p>
