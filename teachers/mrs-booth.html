<h2>Mrs Booth</h2>
<p>Mrs Booth is a <i>very </i>sarcastic <a href="/subjects/geography">geography</a> teacher and is in fact possibly one of BRGS' funniest teachers. If you have a nice class then geography with Miss Leah is actually one of the funnest lessons. She likes to call people 'numpties' whenever they say something dumb.</p>
<h3>The Panda Incident of '19</h3>
<p>During one Intake 16 lesson in 2019 it was discovered that Mrs Booth has a deep and undying hatred for pandas. Some of her reasons for this loathing include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"<strong>THEY CAN'T EVOLVE!!"</strong></li>
  <li>(pitch increasing) <i><strong>"THEY DO IVF FOR PANDAS BECAUSE THEY <u>CANNOT</u> BE BOTHERED TO REPRODUCE THEMSELVES." "WHY?? WHY?? BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY!"</strong></i></li>
  <li><i><strong>"<u>THEY WON'T EVEN EAT ANY FOOD THAT'S BEEN TOUCHED BY HUMANS!"</u></strong></i></li>
</ul>
<p>Some bright sparks have even noticed that a couple of teachers seem to have something against our bear friends, with Mr Flynn and <a href="/teachers/mrs-stevenson-jones">Mrs Stevenson-Jones</a> both disliking polar bears, and Mrs Booth disliking pandas... is there a connection?</p>
<h3>Spiderwoman?</h3>
<p>A particular class was once just chatting to Mrs Booth about her hobbies and one of which was 'climbing' alongside walking, sewing, and reading. The class thought nothing of it until one observant student noticed that there was a gluestick on a ledge halfway up the wall, far out of reach from any normal human.</p>
<p>Upon asking her about it Mrs Booth quickly changed the subject back to geography and told the student not to ask such silly questions (as we were supposed to be working in silence).</p>

  <p>"I don't want any parents to see me in the supermarket with a trolley full of wine, that's why I live so far away from school. Just kidding."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I hate Lord of the Rings, it's way too long and it's like 90% Elvish songs, it's the only book I've never read fully because there are way too many Elvish songs. Like Tolkien could have literally written 'They sang fullstop' but oh no, he went and wrote 30 pages of choruses and verses of songs about elves!"</p>

  <p>Mrs Booth: Always do your work in black or blue pen and your diagrams in pencil <i>no matter what Mr Fitton says.</i></p>
  <p>Student: Erm, he's left now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Student: Miss, why is this part of the map grey?</p>
  <p>Mrs Booth: There is no data for the language they speak there.</p>
  <p>Student:...Or maybe they just don't speak.</p>
  <p>Mrs Booth: No.</p>

  <p>Student: Yeah.</p>
  <p>Mrs Booth: They're adding another floor to the art department.</p>
  <p>Student: Yeah, but what are they doing now?</p>
  <p>Mrs Booth: I don't know! I don't just get a copy of their daily schedule like 'Wednesday, 14th November: Hammer...'"</p>
