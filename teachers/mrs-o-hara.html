<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/mrs_o'hara.png"></figure>
<p>Mrs O'Hara is without doubt one of the nicest and funniest teachers to set foot into <a href="/groups/places/brgs">BRGS</a> (although of course, this may just be the <a href="/subjects/german">German</a> teacher vibe as all of them are among the best teachers) and seems to have a story about almost every single word in the German dictionary.</p>
