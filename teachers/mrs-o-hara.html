<h2>Mrs O'Hara</h2>
<p>Mrs O'Hara is without doubt one of the nicest and funniest teachers to set foot into BRGS (although of course, this may just be the German teacher vibe as all of them are among the best teachers) and seems to have a story about almost every single word in the German dictionary.</p>
