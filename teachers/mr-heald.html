<h2>Mr Heald</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/mr_heald.png"></figure>
<p>Mr Heald was a <a href="/subjects/physics">Physics</a> teacher that joined in 2019, he does a raffle where you can win chocolate (or deal it on the black market- his words). Tells at least one story a lesson such as; a German cannibal, a girl who did drugs and then drank so much that she died and someone from his school that went on a Spanish exchange and had an appendicitis then died. On Fridays he wears a bow tie (bow tie Fridays) because "Wearing a bow tie everyday is too extravagant" his dog also wears a bow tie. Apparently he is the same height he was when he was fourteen. During lockdown, like many people, he has shaved his head, and not like many people, got two kittens. These cats are rumoured to be the true <a href="/subjects/physics/physics-cat">Physics Cats</a> that <a href="/groups/rooms/science/7">Room 7</a> is a shrine to.</p>
<p>When it was his birthday his form made him a bunch of Obama prisms and he his them all around the staffroom, and various other science classrooms. There is still one in <a href="/groups/rooms/science/9">Room 9</a> on top of the cupboards.</p>
<p>Is supposedly the staffroom's in-house DJ.</p>
<h3>His (second) Haircut</h3>
<p>As fellow <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> department members have described it…</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Imagine an egg in a bow tie."</li>
  <li>Or more simply… “Megamind.”</li>
</ul>
