<p>Mr Heald is a Physics teacher that joined in 2019, he does a raffle where you can win chocolate (or deal it on the black market- his words). Tells at least one story a lesson such as; a German cannibal, a girl who did drugs and then drank so much that she died and someone from his school that went on a Spanish exchange and had an appendicitis then died. On Fridays he wears a bow tie (bow tie Fridays) because "Wearing a bow tie everyday is too extravagant" his dog also wears a bow tie. Apparently he is the same height he was when he was fourteen. During lockdown, like many people, he has shaved his head, and not like many people, got a kitten. This cat is rumoured to be the true Physics Cat that Room 7 is a shrine to.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:23.86%;"><img src="/mr-heald.png"><figcaption>Mr Heald after shaving his head in lockdown</figcaption></figure><h3>Quotes</h3><blockquote><p>(Upon being asked if he liked the <a href="/other/meme-pages">meme pages</a>.)
