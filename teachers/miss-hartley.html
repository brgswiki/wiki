<p>Miss Hartley is a chemistry teacher who despite all her atrocious jokes is actually rather strict. She is often seen sporting a mustard cardigan and her 'duck leg' tights, these are then matched with often a blue dress resulting in the biggest insult to fashion seen, only to be beaten to this title by <a href="/teachers/mrs-bowdler">Mrs Bowdler</a> and her blazers. Miss Hartley is also obsessed with learning objectives and spends the first half of the lesson making you copy down what you would do in the lesson but then usually run out of time doing because she spent so long making you write down the learning objectives.</p>
