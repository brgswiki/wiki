<h2>Miss Hartley</h2>
<p>Miss Hartley is a <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a> teacher who likes to tell a lot of <s>atrocious</s> jokes. She is often seen sporting a mustard cardigan and her 'duck leg' tights. Miss Hartley is also obsessed with learning objectives and spends the first half of the lesson making you copy down what you would do in the lesson but then usually run out of time doing because she spent so long making you write down the learning objectives.</p>
