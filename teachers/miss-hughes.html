<h2>Miss Hughes</h2>
<p>Miss Hughes was a cover teacher who left in 2022. Depending if she liked your class or not she would've had different levels of strictness. One time we had her for drama and she just let us do love triangles instead of whatever <a href="/teachers/past/mrs-fowler-gibbs">Mrs Fowler-Gibbs</a>' cover work was. She is pretty chill and normally lets you talk etc.&nbsp;</p>
