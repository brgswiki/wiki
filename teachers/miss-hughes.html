<h2>Miss Hughes</h2>
<p>Miss Hughes is a cover teacher who depending if she likes your class or not will have different levels of strictness. One time we had her for drama and she just let us do love triangles instead of whatever <a href="/teachers/past/mrs-fowler-gibbs">Mrs Fowler-Gibbs</a>' cover work was. She is pretty chill and normally lets you talk etc.&nbsp;</p>
