<p>Mrs Saunders is a science supply teacher, covering for biology in 2017 and chemistry in 2019. Whilst we were in Year 9, she gave us the A-Level revision list for our end of year exams. Needless to say, after our class were all revising god-knows-what some bright spark decided to compare it to Mr Chambers' class revision list and saved us a lot of trouble learning about the colours of products of certain reactions. Many will never forget the moment she walked into their chemistry lessons only to discover she had died her hair a bright purple-red. Even though she is a cover teacher, she steals PowerPoints from the internet rather than writing them herself or using the schools, and then as she is going through it she'll make comments such as "That's wrong.... that's also wrong, gosh who writes these?" and "oh yeah that's stuff you don't need to know for GCSE" and then continues to skip the rest of the PowerPoint and give us laptops to learn the topic ourselves. Fortunately, Mrs Saunders is a very chill teacher and would let you write on the whiteboard as soon as she turned her back, go on your phone etc.</p><h3>Nanny McPhee?</h3><p>Not only is Mrs Saunders an atrocious cover teacher, it is also rumoured she is Nanny McPhee. This is not only down to her appearance, but also the very similar rule that follows the lines of "whenever you don't want me, I'll be here, and when you do want me I have to go."&nbsp;</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:43.35%;"><img src="/mrs-saunders.png"><figcaption>Nanny McPhee?</figcaption></figure><h3>Quotes</h3><blockquote><p>"AAAAUUUUUAUAUAAGHHHH NOT DOWN THE SINK (ungodly screeching)"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Go away!!"
