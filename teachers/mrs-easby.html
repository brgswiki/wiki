<h2>Mrs Easby</h2>
<p>Mrs Easby is a maths teacher who joined BRGS at the start of last school year. She is very nice and probably the most enthusiastic maths teacher when talking about maths, proving almost impossible tasks - like making even topics like quadratic graphs seem a little less boring - actually possible.</p>
<p>Her favourite catchphrase is definitely ‘Maths is Easby’ and if you ever have her in her Maths Classroom, you'll see a wall saying ‘Maths is Easby’ across it, as well as a number of (hilarious) Maths jokes.</p>
<p>Absolutely loves using the word 'noob'.</p>
