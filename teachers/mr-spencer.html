<p>Mr Spencer is Head of Geography and married to <a href="/teachers/mrs-spencer">Mrs Spencer</a>. He is very nice and obsessed with drumlins. He is very touchy when it comes to new equipment, do not break it. He is a good teacher and nice up until the moment you talk too much in his lesson, which a <a href="/students/intake18">18W</a> once did and one lesson they messed up a box of crayons and he gave them a lesson of silence and copying out of the textbook. He does not like flat Earthers and thinks that accents are very important in Geography. Always wears the same butterfly tie. Once got locked out of his classroom by his students so had to climb through a window as <a href="/teachers/miss-leah">Miss Leah</a> and <a href="/teachers/miss-foster">Miss Foster</a> abandoned their classes to watch him and commentate rather than help.</p>
<p>He is not exempt from the geography teacher competition that seems to be 'who can deforest a rainforest the fastest by handing out copious amounts of sheets each lesson.' His favourite movie is The Lion King.</p>
<p>Don't break equipment or talk over him, and answer questions.</p>
