<p>Mr Foster is an <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> teacher who joined the school in the year 2020/2021. Little is yet known about him, except when he reads a chapter which is meant to be frightening, he reads it really intensely, like someone in the room is actually about to die.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is currently the only male member of the English department, breaking their long going tradition of at least a number of years. <s>(Excluding </s><a href="/teachers/supply/mr-blacoe"><s>Mr Blacoe</s></a><s>)</s></p>
