<h2>Mr Foster</h2>
<p>Mr Foster is an English teacher who joined the school in the year 2020/2021. Little is yet known about him, except when he reads an chapter which is meant to be frightening, he reads it really intensely, like someone in the room is actually about to die. You have been warned. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
