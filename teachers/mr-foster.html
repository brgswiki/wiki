<h2>Mr Foster</h2>
<p>Mr Foster is an <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/en/subjects/english">English</a> teacher who joined the school in the year 2020/2021. Little is yet known about him, except when he reads a chapter which is meant to be frightening, he reads it really intensely, like someone in the room is actually about to die. You have been warned. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
