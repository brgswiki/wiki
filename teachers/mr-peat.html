<h2>Mr Peat</h2>

<p>Mr Peat left BRGS in 2016/17 school year, but has now returned to replace <a href="/teachers/past/mrs-appleton-why">Mrs Appleton-Why</a>. He also has a <a href="/students/intake18">Year 9</a> form - it would be a miracle if this year group doesn't scare him away.</p>
<p>He is an expert on American history and has a strange passion for Lyndon B Johnson. In general he's pretty chill and a good teacher who makes History a lot more fun than it actually is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His doppelganger is <a href="/teachers/mr-stringer">Mr Stringer</a>, who apparently is quite chuffed by this comparison. Some classes speculate that his first name is also in fact Pete, therefore making his name Pete Peat and that the first initial of ‘R’ on his email is just a cover.</p>
<p>He may be also be a secret motorbike rider as on one non-uniform day, he came in with ripped jeans, very different from his typical suit attire.</p>
