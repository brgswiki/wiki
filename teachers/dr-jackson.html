<h2>Dr Jackson</h2>
<p>Dr Jackson is a biology teacher. Her office is situated on the basement corridor, wedged between the IT technicians' rooms. This was supposedly so there would be less stairs to climb although BRGS has quite a stair abundant architecture and therefore there are probably even more stairs.</p>
