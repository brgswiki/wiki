<h2>Dr Jackson</h2>
<p>Dr Jackson is a <a href="/subjects/biology">biology</a> teacher. Her office is situated on the basement corridor, wedged between the IT technicians' rooms. This was supposedly so there would be less stairs to climb although BRGS has quite a stair abundant architecture and therefore there are probably even more stairs.</p>
