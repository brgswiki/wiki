<p>Mr Mercer is a music teacher. He can get angry but he's usually very nice. Once <a href="/teachers/mrs-bowdler">Mrs Bowdler</a> grabbed the microphone at the big sing to start singing and he practically hurdled over tables to take it off her. He is more invested in <a href="/groups/events/the-big-sing">The Big Sing</a> than any of the other music teachers. He plays practically every instrument. Him and Timothy (<a href="/teachers/mr-webber">Mr Webber</a>) are good friends. He practically invented the ukelele, he plays it so well you can almost tell what tune it is.</p>
