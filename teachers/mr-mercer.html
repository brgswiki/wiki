<p>Mr Mercer is a music teacher. He can get angry but he's usually very nice. Once Mrs Bowdler grabbed the microphone at the big sing to start singing and he practically hurdled over tables to take it off her. He is more invested in the big sing than any of the other music teachers. He plays practically every instrument. Him and Timothy (Mr Webber) are good friends. He practically invented the ukelele , he plays it so well you can almost tell what tune it is.</p>

  <p>Mercer: You want anything, sir?</p>
  <p>Webber: Oh, Iâ€™ll just have a packet of nuts or something.</p>
  <p>Mercer: Okidoki.</p>
  <p>Mercer goes</p>
  <p>Webber: Actually no, I can have whatever I want. (Opens other door) CAN YOU MAKE IT A BACON BUTTY AND A CHOCOLATE MILKSHAKE? THANK YOU"</p>
