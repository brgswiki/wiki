<p>Mrs Chapman is a maths teacher, and seems to go on every school trip possible. She has been teaching at the school for years, possibly only beaten by the <a href="/teachers/past/miss-bowden">Bowdenator</a> who has probably been here since the school was built.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs Chapman does not take kindly to the nickname 'Chappers' although students and teachers alike have been heard using it. If she likes her classes or you have her Period 5 on a Friday (even if you have a test) she often puts on a music playlist, and each week the music genre seems to change dramatically. According to <a href="/teachers/past/mr-ventress">Mr Ventress</a>, Mrs Chapman is "really good at the 'squiddley-bop'." (dance move apparently)</p>
<h3>Mrs Chapman's Arch Nemesis</h3>
<p>Many classes who have had Mrs Chapman will remember the lessons with wasps the most. This is because Mrs Chapman seems to have a deep loathing for them and will stop at nothing to make sure they are defeated. This includes standing on desks, jumping from desk to desk<i>, </i>and hitting students with maths textbooks. In fact, in one such lesson may have been the closest she has ever come to swearing in class. One of her classes even bought her an electric insect swatter at the end of the year and she cried.</p>
<h3>'Sufficient Tentage'</h3>
<p>Mrs Chapman is well known for running pretty much all of the camping or outdoor activity based trips. This includes <a href="/groups/trips/anglesey">Anglesey</a>, <a href="/groups/trips/year-9-camp">Year 9 Camp</a>, and Duke of Edinburgh. In the unlikely event that Chappers isn't actually organising a trip, she will still go on it as she seems to be on every <a href="/groups/trips">school trip</a> possible.</p>
