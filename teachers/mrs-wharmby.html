<h2>Mrs Wharmby</h2>
<p>Mrs Wharmby is the new Head of <a href="/subjects/chemistry">Chemistry</a>, although she has large shoes to fill following the <a href="/teachers/past/miss-bowden">Bowdenator</a>! She has also relieved <a href="/teachers/mrs-stevenson-jones">Mrs Stevenson-Jones</a> by taking one of her <a href="/students/intake16">Year 11</a> chemistry classes (as Stevey-J had been singlehandedly teaching chemistry to almost half of this year group).</p>
