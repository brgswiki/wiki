<h2>Mrs Wharmby</h2>
<p>Mrs Wharmby is a new <a href="/subjects/chemistry">Chemistry</a> teacher, although she has large shoes to fill following the <a href="/teachers/past/miss-bowden">Bowdenator</a>! She has also relieved <a href="/teachers/mrs-stevenson-jones">Mrs Stevenson-Jones</a> by taking one of her <a href="/students/intake16">Year 11</a> chemistry classes (as Stevey-J had been singlehandedly teaching chemistry to almost half of this year group). Mrs Wharmby is also <a href="/students/intake20/b">20B</a>'s form tutor.</p>
<p>Mrs Wharmby has a very pessimistic view of what students' work ethic and in her words “you are all guilty until proven innocent - if I haven't <i>seen</i> the homework, you haven't done it.” and the classic “you were probably up until 3 each night gaming or watching Netflix instead of doing these chemistry sheets.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>She also is no fan of hoodies and <i>will </i>tell you to take it off if it isn't a PE hoodie, despite many students trying to convince her that we are allowed to wear any navy or black hoodies.</p>

<h3>Email Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Congratulations - you have made it to half term break! I am proud of how you have handled such a challenging half term, whilst maintaining high standards of work. It is important that you take time to relax with your family, ready for what will no doubt be a another hectic half term. As you are in Year 11 (and you don't get GCSEs for free!) have a think about whether you could complete some work over the half term e.g. to catch up or revise a weaker topic. If so, try a scaled down version of your normal timetable (choose your favourite week one or week two) so that you can still have a rest."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Hello lovely CONSCIENTIOUS people. Should you wish to finish that alkenes worksheet (people at home I forgot to say only the second side!!), then the answers are attached (again, second side).<br><br>This is completely optional for anyone who wishes to be conscientious and get a good grade! Email me if you have any questions from today.<br><br>Calculators tomorrow for calculation fun!!!"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>(The night before the chem mock) “And finally, remember you do not get GCSEs for free so don’t even think about staying up late on your phone/computer/Netflix! Sensible bedtime please!!”</p>
