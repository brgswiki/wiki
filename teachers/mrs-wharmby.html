<h2>Mrs Wharmby</h2>
<p>Mrs Wharmby is a new <a href="/subjects/chemistry">Chemistry</a> teacher, although she has large shoes to fill following the <a href="/teachers/past/miss-bowden">Bowdenator</a>! She has also relieved <a href="/teachers/mrs-stevenson-jones">Mrs Stevenson-Jones</a> by taking one of her <a href="/students/intake16">Year 11</a> chemistry classes (as Stevey-J had been singlehandedly teaching chemistry to almost half of this year group). Mrs Wharmby is also <a href="/students/intake20/b">20B</a>'s form tutor.</p>
<p>Mrs Wharmby has a very pessimistic view of what students' work ethic and in her words “you are all guilty until proven innocent - if I haven't <i>seen</i> the homework, you haven't done it.” and the classic “you were probably up until 3 each night gaming or watching Netflix instead of doing these chemistry sheets.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>She also is no fan of hoodies and <i>will </i>tell you to take it off if it isn't a PE hoodie, despite many students trying to convince her that we are allowed to wear any navy or black hoodies.</p>

  <p>“I was really really strangely proud of myself. But yesterday, so on a Wednesday I go into school in the mornin', but come home as soon as I can in the morning as well, but because I was sorting out exams and people had to do catch-ups I was marking that etc etc, I ended up having to stay to sort the papers out and I had two live lessons - I couldn't leave because I had to make sure I was doing them… and then it was lunch, and I had year 10 after lunch. So I thought ‘right, I can do this. I'm gonna quickly go home during lunch.’ So, by the time I'd sorted everything it was 12:43 - that's when I set off… I got home at… 1:07. And I was on Google Meet with Year 10 at 1:10. Can you believe that?? Did I speed? Erm well, I didn't <i>speed</i>… There was a couple of times on the fast roads where I maybe went faster than I would <i>normally.</i> How good is that? I really, really, really… really- I was telling my Year 13 and like tell me how good that is. I weren't speeding! I honestly wasn't speeding! I just like… just went <i>faster</i> than I would <i>normally </i>go.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Basically, when you get to a certain age, you get really excited about certain things. Such as… getting a new vacuum. Last weekend I got a new vacuum, and honestly, I was so excited. One day you'll understand, and you'll think about me, and you'll think ‘she was onto sommit’. So my husband's really tight and the vacuum that we had - the wire, I had to hold the wire in a certain position - it was so funny. It just stopped working and I was like ‘<i><strong>we’re getting a new vacuum</strong></i>' and he was like ‘<i><strong>I will fix it! We’re not getting a new vacuum.</strong></i>' so we had like a massive dramatic row over this vacuum and he tried to fix it, and he broke it. So I was so…. EXCITED and so HAPPY, and I just thought ‘you deserve that’. And I got… a new vacuum. A new Shark Vacuum. And he was happy about that cause its got red on it for Man United - that's what I told him. Anyway, I used it at the weekend… WELL GOOD. I was so EXCITED to properly use it again. Mmm it's gonna be so much fun."&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Email Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Congratulations - you have made it to half term break! I am proud of how you have handled such a challenging half term, whilst maintaining high standards of work. It is important that you take time to relax with your family, ready for what will no doubt be a another hectic half term. As you are in Year 11 (and you don't get GCSEs for free!) have a think about whether you could complete some work over the half term e.g. to catch up or revise a weaker topic. If so, try a scaled down version of your normal timetable (choose your favourite week one or week two) so that you can still have a rest."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Hello lovely CONSCIENTIOUS people. Should you wish to finish that alkenes worksheet (people at home I forgot to say only the second side!!), then the answers are attached (again, second side).<br><br>This is completely optional for anyone who wishes to be conscientious and get a good grade! Email me if you have any questions from today.<br><br>Calculators tomorrow for calculation fun!!!"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>(The night before the chem mock) “And finally, remember you do not get GCSEs for free so don’t even think about staying up late on your phone/computer/Netflix! Sensible bedtime please!!”</p>
