<h2>Mrs Wharmby</h2>
<p>Mrs Wharmby is a new <a href="/subjects/chemistry">Chemistry</a> teacher, although she has large shoes to fill following the <a href="/teachers/past/miss-bowden">Bowdenator</a>! She has also relieved <a href="/teachers/mrs-stevenson-jones">Mrs Stevenson-Jones</a> by taking one of her <a href="/students/intake16">Year 11</a> chemistry classes (as Stevey-J had been singlehandedly teaching chemistry to almost half of this year group). Mrs Wharmby is also <a href="/students/intake20/b">20B</a>'s form tutor.</p>
<p>Mrs Wharmby has a very pessimistic view of what students' work ethic and in her words “you are all guilty until proven innocent - if I haven't <i>seen</i> the homework, you haven't done it.” and the classic “you were probably up until 3 each night gaming or watching Netflix instead of doing these chemistry sheets.” She also is no fan of hoodies and <i>will </i>tell you to take it off if it isn't a PE hoodie, despite many students trying to convince her that we are allowed to wear any navy or black hoodies.</p>
