<h2>Mrs Wharmby</h2>
<p>Mrs Wharmby is a <a href="/subjects/chemistry">Chemistry</a> teacher. She has also relieved <a href="/teachers/mrs-stevenson-jones">Mrs Stevenson-Jones</a> by taking one of her <a href="/students/intake16">Year 11</a> chemistry classes (as Stevey-J had been singlehandedly teaching chemistry to almost half of this year group). Mrs Wharmby is also <a href="/students/intake20/b">20B</a>'s form tutor.</p>
<p>Mrs Wharmby has a very pessimistic view of what students' work ethic and in her words “you are all guilty until proven innocent - if I haven't <i>seen</i> the homework, you haven't done it.” and the classic “you were probably up until 3 each night gaming or watching Netflix instead of doing these chemistry sheets.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Absolutely loves the word ‘dramatic’, the Masked Singer, and her newly acquired vacuum cleaner. Not such a big fan of acronyms, uber eats, or hoodies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Likes to complain about how much her classes <s>11J1</s> complain.</p>
<p>“She has that sarcastic Burnley humour.” ~ <a href="/teachers/mr-stringer">Stringer</a></p>
<h3>Chemistry Lessons for Beginners</h3>
<p>A useful guide to decipher any code for those partaking in Mrs W's chemistry lessons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“I have a treat for you" = exam questions</li>
  <li>“This is literally the peak of the entire course.” = you are about to embark on one of the most boring lessons (usually about glass or paper or something) in your life</li>
  <li>“That's so dramatic oh my god.” = someone probably dropped a pen or something</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hoodied but Unbowed</h3>
<p>Credited with coining the phrase ‘non BRGS PE hoodie’.</p>
<p>Mrs W is no fan of hoodies and <i>will </i>tell you to take it off if it isn't a PE hoodie, despite many students trying to convince her that we are allowed to wear any navy or black hoodies. Unfortunately, she has decided to heed Mr Reeves' most recent words of wisdom to the masses and intends to fight mercilessly for his latest (losing) war on uniform.</p>

  <p>“I was really really strangely proud of myself. But yesterday, so on a Wednesday I go into school in the mornin', but come home as soon as I can in the morning as well, but because I was sorting out exams and people had to do catch-ups I was marking that etc etc, I ended up having to stay to sort the papers out and I had two live lessons - I couldn't leave because I had to make sure I was doing them… and then it was lunch, and I had year 10 after lunch. So I thought ‘right, I can do this. I'm gonna quickly go home during lunch.’ So, by the time I'd sorted everything it was 12:43 - that's when I set off… I got home at… 1:07. And I was on Google Meet with Year 10 at 1:10. Can you believe that?? Did I speed? Erm well, I didn't <i>speed</i>… There was a couple of times on the fast roads where I maybe went faster than I would <i>normally.</i> How good is that? I really, really, really… really- I was telling my Year 13 and like tell me how good that is. I weren't speeding! I honestly wasn't speeding! I just like… just went <i>faster</i> than I would <i>normally </i>go.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Basically, when you get to a certain age, you get really excited about certain things. Such as… getting a new vacuum. Last weekend I got a new vacuum, and honestly, I was so excited. One day you'll understand, and you'll think about me, and you'll think ‘she was onto sommit’. So my husband's really tight and the vacuum that we had - the wire, I had to hold the wire in a certain position - it was so funny. It just stopped working and I was like ‘<i><strong>we’re getting a new vacuum</strong></i>' and he was like ‘<i><strong>I will fix it! We’re not getting a new vacuum.</strong></i>' so we had like a massive dramatic row over this vacuum and he tried to fix it, and he broke it. So I was so…. EXCITED and so HAPPY, and I just thought ‘you deserve that’. And I got… a new vacuum. A new Shark Vacuum. And he was happy about that cause its got red on it for Man United - that's what I told him. Anyway, I used it at the weekend… WELL GOOD. I was so EXCITED to properly use it again. Mmm it's gonna be so much fun."&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Email Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Congratulations - you have made it to half term break! I am proud of how you have handled such a challenging half term, whilst maintaining high standards of work. It is important that you take time to relax with your family, ready for what will no doubt be a another hectic half term. As you are in Year 11 (and you don't get GCSEs for free!) have a think about whether you could complete some work over the half term e.g. to catch up or revise a weaker topic. If so, try a scaled down version of your normal timetable (choose your favourite week one or week two) so that you can still have a rest."</p>
