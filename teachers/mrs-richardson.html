<p>Mrs Richardson is a PSHE teacher. She is usually very chill and nice but once we had her for a terrorist alarm and some people hid in a cupboard and filmed it and she then burst into the cupboard and told them they would all be dead if this was real. She has been sighted dressed as a crow in Hebden Bridge. She used to be Geography teacher and used to live in Africa.&nbsp;</p>
