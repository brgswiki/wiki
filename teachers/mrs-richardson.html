<h2>Mrs Richardson</h2>
<p>Mrs Richardson is a PSHCE teacher. She is usually very chill and nice but once we had her for a terrorist alarm and some people hid in a cupboard and filmed it and she then burst into the cupboard and told them they would all be dead if this was real. Mrs Richardson is more environment focused than other PSHCE and makes a lot of projects based around sustainability rather than what the other PSHCE teachers are doing. She used to be Geography teacher and used to live in Africa.&nbsp;</p>
