<p>Mrs Richardson is a PSHE teacher. She is usually very chill and nice but once we had her for a terrorist alarm and some people hid in a cupboard and filmed it and she then burst into the cupboard and told them they would all be dead if this was real. She has been sighted in Hebden Bridge. She used to be Geography teacher and used to live in Africa.&nbsp;</p>
