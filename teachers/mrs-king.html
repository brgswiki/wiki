<h2>Mrs King</h2>
<p>Mrs King is an English teacher. She is one of the best English teachers and if you have her you'll actually be able to analyse things in depth.</p>
<p>Mrs King doesn't appreciate it if you spend lesson time racing down the English block stairs rather than doing English work. Unfortunately, some of <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/students/intake18/w">18W</a> found this out the hard way.</p>
