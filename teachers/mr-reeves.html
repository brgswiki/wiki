<h2>Mr Reeves</h2>
<p>Mr Reeves is a deputy head, head of lower years, member of the senior leadership team, head of pastoral care, MBE, grade II listed, etc etc etc... Reeves is also a <a href="/subjects/maths">maths</a> teacher, but only teaches A-Level students. He can also do a number of flawless animal impressions, including a horse (along with 'clip clop clip clop'), a crocodile, and a dog (although this is down to debate, it can also be argued he was acting as a rabid fox). It was also decided that he would be more likely to go around in a zorb ball than <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a>. Ignore the electric chair and thumbscrews in his office - they are rarely used.</p>
<h3>Deputy Headship</h3>
<p>He comes along on almost every school trip, apart from <a href="/groups/trips/ypres">Ypres</a> where he can finally take the reins of the school for three days as this is the only trip the Porteii go on, other than that, Alan defends his headship (relatively) determinedly, the only other times Reeves has the power over the school is whenever Mr P is running late on his paper round of delivering various mock papers and sixth form application letters. Saying that, Mr Reeves seems to near impossibly do almost every role under the sun to hold up the school, whereas Alan becomes more and more hellbent on building the (insert number here)th extension, locking himself in his office for days at a time to design the next step towards total conquest of Waterfoot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reevsie is often found patrolling the classrooms at lunchtime, and does not appreciate people throwing things around. If you are caught doing such an act he will just point at you then symbol with his hands to go over to him. Unfortunately for him, the lack of speaking means that one can often pretend they misunderstood him, especially if he is signalling through a window, or just wave back at him then continue along on your merry way.</p>
<h3>Past Life</h3>
<p>It is rumoured that Mr Reeves could do trigonometry and quadratic graphs from the age of one, and indeed before he could walk. He was a self-acclaimed ‘party animal’ during his sixth form days though this is yet to be confirmed by secondary sources…</p>
<p>He once seemed to think he was Spiderman and then consequently broke his wrist. (A passage from the old BRGSWiki states 'In what was possibly his first ever assembly at BRGS he opened with the words "I had a strange dream last night. I was Spiderman. He then explained what this was all about, and said, "I always knew I was Spiderman", and "that is my gift and that is my curse, who am I? I'm Spiderman!")</p>
<p>At some point during his mysterious past he has lived in New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Assemblies</h3>

  <figcaption>Getting the motivation to make lockdown assemblies</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Mr Reeves makes many assemblies. His devotion for them was shown during the coronavirus lockdown when he recorded an assembly each week and then sent it to all the BRGS pupils. In the past, many of his assemblies have revolved around acronyms that are used for about a week then discarded. Such acronyms include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PINK (pause influencers naked know)</li>
  <li>RROAST (also affectionately referred to as the BRGS Values, these are resilience, respect, opportunity, ambition, support, trust - credit to <a href="/teachers/mrs-grehan">Mrs Grehan</a> for putting together the acronym)</li>
  <li>PAW (passion, ability, willingness)</li>
  <li>DEAR (drop everything and read)</li>
  <li>Not an acronym, but Growth Mindset. The idea was to add 'yet' to a sentence ie. "I can't do this... yet" however many people siezed the opportunity and used things like "I haven't been to prison... yet" or "I haven't done drugs... yet."</li>
  <li>WBWA (wipe before, wipe after)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr Reeves is also the proud creator and owner of the <a href="/other/behaviour-for-learning-policy">Behaviour For Learning Policy</a> which is an elaborate ploy to take up a number of pages in our planners and the value of a penalty point changes each year - just to keep staff and students on their toes.</p>
<h3>Paw Patrol</h3>
<p>Reevsie has shown that he has an affinity for Paw Patrol. He once did a whole assembly on Paw Patrol, and later that year during the school Quiz Night he based a whole round on Paw Patrol and didn't understand why you got 0/10 unless you had a little kid you could bribe with various snacks at your own loss.</p>
<h3>Various Greetings</h3>
<p>When walking up to school, Mr Reeves seems to have a different greeting for every single group of students every single day. It is unknown how he comes up with so many. Some examples include:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"GREETINGS! GOOD MORROW!!"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>(On a rainy day, Mr Reeves looking particularly unwaterproof) "Morning. Notice how I didn't say 'good'?"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Good morning, chapatitas!"</p>
