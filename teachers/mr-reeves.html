<h2>Mr Reeves</h2>
<p>Mr Reeves is a deputy head, head of lower years, member of the senior leadership team, head of pastoral care, and numerous other titles that hold little meaning. He can also do a number of flawless animal impressions, including a horse (along with 'clip clop clip clop'), a crocodile, and a dog (although this is down to debate, it can also be argued he was acting as a rabid fox). It was also decided that he would be more likely to go around in a zorb ball than <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a>.</p>

<p>Reevsie is often found patrolling the classrooms at lunchtime, and does not appreciate people throwing things around. If you are caught doing such an act he will just point at you then symbol with his hands to go over to him. Unfortunately for him, the lack of speaking means that one can often pretend they misunderstood him, especially if he is signalling through a window, or just wave back at him then continue along on your merry way.</p>
<h3>Assemblies</h3>
<p>Mr Reeves makes many assemblies. His devotion for them was shown during the coronavirus lockdown when he recorded an assembly each week and then sent it to all the BRGS pupils. In the past, many of his assemblies have revolved around acronyms that are used for about a week then discarded. Such acronyms include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PINK (pause influencers <i>naked</i> know)</li>
  <li>RROAST (also unaffectionately referred to as the BRGS Values, these are resilience, respect, opportunity, ambition, support, trust)</li>
  <li>PAW (passion, ability, willingness)</li>
  <li>DEAR (drop everything and read)</li>
  <li>Not an acronym, but Growth Mindset. The idea was to add 'yet' to a sentence ie. "I can't do this... yet" however many people took the opportunity and used things like "I haven't been to prison... yet" or "I haven't done drugs... yet."</li>
</ul>
<h3>Paw Patrol</h3>
<p>Reevsie has shown that he does in fact, have an affinity for Paw Patrol. He once did a whole assembly on Paw Patrol, and later that year during the school Quiz Night he based a whole round on Paw Patrol and didn't understand why unless you had a younger child hanging around to spare you got 0/10.&nbsp;</p>
