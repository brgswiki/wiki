<p>Dr Heaton is a <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a> teacher. He rose to fame after his assembly all about Peppa Pig World. Despite living in Lancashire, he is a true Yorkshire man at heart. He is also <a href="/students/intake16/n">16N's</a> form tutor.</p>

  <figcaption>Mark (left) compared to Dr Heaton (right)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Dr Heaton shares more than a passing resemblance to Mark from the 2020 Sewing Bee (see right hand side).</p>
<p>Not only this, but it is possible he has been sighted at Yarndale (a knitting and sewing festival in Skipton) although this is yet to be confirmed...</p>
