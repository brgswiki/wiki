<h2>Dr Heaton</h2>
<p>Dr Heaton is a <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a> teacher. He rose to fame after his assembly all about Peppa Pig World. Despite living in Lancashire, he is a true Yorkshire man at heart. He is also <a href="/students/intake16/n">16N's</a> form tutor. Would like to point out he is Head of Chemistry and was not chuffed with our (accidental) demotion in his wiki category. He's so devoted to chemistry in fact that one of his children has been blessed with the middle name Avogadro, and their first and last initial are PH (as in pH).</p>
<p>Thinks concrete is neat.</p>
<h3>A Hidden Seamster?</h3>

  <figcaption>Mark (left) compared to Dr Heaton (right)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Dr Heaton shares more than a passing resemblance to Mark from the 2020 Sewing Bee (see right hand side).</p>
<p>Not only this, but it is possible he has been sighted at Yarndale (a knitting and sewing festival in Skipton) although this is yet to be confirmed...</p>
<h3>Free Science Guy</h3>

<p>Since there is no logical reason to hate on the man, the myth, the legend Shaun Donnelly, it can only be concluded Dr Heaton is heading for competition with the free science lessons youtube (and from our perspective is definitely heading there). All he needs now is to step up his green screen skills and we'll make a famous YouTuber out of him yet. We are yet to find out where the other chemistry teachers stand on the free science lessons guy…</p>
<h3>Lockdown Memories</h3>
<p>Managed to break the board multiple times in one lesson simply trying to get up one question he could have written on the board 20 times over in the time taken to get it fixed*<i> (</i>*if fixed means just moving to the next classroom over until that one breaks).</p>
<p>Some iconic quotes from this strife with the whiteboard(s) include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(shrugs helplessly as another pop-up appears) “you should just be able to turn it off though.”</li>
  <li>(starts pulling at a spaghetti of wires at the back of the board)</li>
  <li>(begins looking underneath the whiteboard in hope of clues)</li>
  <li>(whilst clicking the on/off button for the first time in half an hour) “Is that a button?”</li>
  <li>(stares blankly at the settings pop-up on the board until it just disappears)</li>
  <li>(defeated but not giving up) “It's a matter of pride now.”</li>
</ul>
