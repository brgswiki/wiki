<h2>Dr Heaton</h2>
<p>Dr Heaton is a <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a> teacher. He rose to fame after his assembly all about Peppa Pig World. Despite living in Lancashire, he is a true Yorkshire man at heart. He is also <a href="/students/intake16/n">16N's</a> form tutor. Would like to point out he is Head of Chemistry and was not chuffed with our (accidental) demotion in his wiki category. He's so devoted to chemistry in fact that one of his children has been blessed with the middle name Avogadro (although this has now confirmed to be urban myth), and their first and last initial are PH (as in pH).</p>
<p>Thinks concrete is neat.</p>
<h3>A Hidden Seamster?</h3>

<p>Dr Heaton shares more than a passing resemblance to Mark from the 2020 Sewing Bee (see right hand side).</p>
<p>Not only this, but it is possible he has been sighted at Yarndale (a knitting and sewing festival in Skipton) although this is yet to be confirmed...</p>
<h3>Free Science Guy</h3>

<p>Since there is no logical reason to hate on the man, the myth, the legend Shaun Donnelly, it can only be concluded Dr Heaton is heading for competition with the free science lessons youtube (and from our perspective is definitely heading there). All he needs now is to step up his green screen skills and we'll make a famous YouTuber out of him yet. We are yet to find out where the other chemistry teachers stand on the free science lessons guy…</p>
<h3>Lockdown Memories</h3>
<p>Managed to break the board multiple times in one lesson simply trying to get up one question he could have written on the board 20 times over in the time taken to get it fixed*<i> (</i>*if fixed means just moving to the next classroom over until that one breaks).</p>
<p>Some iconic quotes from this strife with the whiteboard(s) include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(shrugs helplessly as another pop-up appears) “you should just be able to turn it off though.”</li>
  <li>(starts pulling at a spaghetti of wires at the back of the board)</li>
  <li>(begins looking underneath the whiteboard in hope of clues)</li>
  <li>(whilst clicking the on/off button for the first time in half an hour) “Is that a button?”</li>
  <li>(stares blankly at the settings pop-up on the board until it just disappears)</li>
  <li>(defeated but not giving up) “It's a matter of pride now.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“It (drawing of some light waves) looks like spaghetti. I'm having spaghetti for tea actually. That's not even a lie.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>(Students in back corner talking about which fruit they'd be during silent work) “Yeah, but would you be green or purple grapes?”</p>
  <p>Dr Heaton: Do I want to even ask?</p>
  <p>Students: What fruit would you be? Like what fruit would have the same energy as you?</p>
  <p>Dr Heaton: Probably a mango… I like mangoes.</p>
  <p>Student: What's the fruit with the lowest energy, sir?</p>
  <p>Dr Heaton: Are you saying that I'd be a low energy fruit? Are you calling me boring? Are you saying that I'd be a fig or something?</p>
  <p>(Later in the lesson)</p>
  <p>Student during 'silent work': LASAGNA?? HOW RUDE! I HAVE <i>NEVER </i>BEEN MORE OFFENDED IN MY LIFE.</p>
  <p>Dr Heaton: What now?</p>
  <p>Student: What type of pasta would you be, sir?</p>
  <p>Doc Heat: Rigatoni. It's a sturdy tube.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bricks are important, but I'd like to think I'm more important that a brick. Actually though, if you were to take away all the bricks in the world that wouldn't be good - so I'll say that I'm less important than all the bricks, but more important than one brick.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I was double booked for the charity run and Thomas the Tank Engine Land, so I'm going to do the charity run later.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Student: Sir, have you seen the freesciencelessons person cut-out in Room 1?</p>
  <p>Dr Heaton: I have. Each lesson I have 10 different students asking me who he is and each time I need to explain. I'll just be stood there teaching, then I'll turn around and see his smug face. He won't be there for long. I know Mrs Wharmby teaches in there most but that doesn't make it her classroom - I might have to buy a shower curtain to put over it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Does anyone know what this molecule is? No? You put it in your car as a fuel and then burn it and then worry about contributing to our rapidly decaying planet.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Doc Heat: The acronym for this NOF although it should really be NuhHuh OhHuh FuhHuh (NHOHFH)</p>
  <p>Student: are you having a stroke, sir?</p>
  <p>Doc Heat: I might be stressed but I’m not that stressed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>”Are we all happy? Can I move on? Well we don’t need to be happy - just understanding the answer. Being happy isn’t a requirement to move onto the next part of the lesson… Although it would be nice if you were happy - I’m not saying don’t be happy. Please be happy.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hello children, what's 4 - 2?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Student: Is there a reason why electrons go around in pairs?</p>
  <p>Dr Heaton: Yeah probably.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We all just love a bit of ammonia.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You probably don't care but I'm going to tell you anyway.”</p>
  <p>contrasted by “You don't need to know this so I'm not going to tell you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>“If you aren't paying attention right now I hope something mildly inconvenient happens to you.”</p>
