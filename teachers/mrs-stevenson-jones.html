<h2>Mrs Stevenson-Jones</h2>
<p>Mrs Stevenson-Jones is one of the (if not the most) fun and legendary <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a> teachers at BRGS. Her emails are widely considered one step away from poetry and it is without doubt possible that the English GCSE exam board may use them in future for students to analyse. She took over from Dr Kirk (a temporary teacher) and basically saved Intake 12's GCSEs.</p>

<p>Like many teachers, she does not care for sheets that aren't stuck in but be warned if you are one of the people who does not care for a glue stick this can lead to many glares from Stevey-J especially if your sheets are all over the desk. Keep in mind that there will only be sheets - never booklets - this is because of a <a href="/subjects/chemistry">Chemistry department</a> rule to never print booklets. However, Mrs SJ has been known to be rebellious a couple of times, leading to lessons where the word 'booklet' is whispered across the classroom to avoid anyone who might be walking past the class from hearing it.</p>
<h3>Love Hate Relationship with Intake 16</h3>
<p>Mrs Stevenson-Jones teaches not one, not two, but in fact 3 <a href="/students/intake16">Year 10</a> (now 11) chemistry classes (we have no idea how she copes! update: it appears she was unable to deal with us and has sent one of her classes to Mrs Wharmby) and at the start of the school year it is said we were her favourite year group, however as the months went on it is more than likely we have sunk down to maybe 5th favourite year group (because no matter how bad we are Year 7s and 8s will still always be worse). Of course the Year 11s also run probably her least favourite <a href="/other/meme-pages">meme page</a> which doesn't help.</p>
<h3>Whiteboard Pens</h3>
<p>Intake 16's plummet in popularity may have been due to the widespread idea of getting the taller people in the class to put <a href="/other/whiteboard-pens">whiteboard pens</a> in high up places in the classroom that Mrs Stevenson-Jones cannot reach. Such places include the top of the whiteboard, the weird ledges <a href="/groups/rooms/science/5">Room 5</a>'s old design features involve, and the top of the projector. If you go into her lessons after a Year 11 class has taken place you may find phrases like 'chemistry bad' at the top of the whiteboard.</p>
<h3>The Dabbing Policy</h3>
<p>Mrs Stevenson-Jones fortunately decided to take action during the dabbing spree of 2016 and would give anyone a penalty point if they dabbed. Of course, Stevey-J herself needed a good excuse to dab and therefore called into place a dabbing policy for her lessons. Once one has mastered quantitative chemistry, they may dab. Of course, because this is only covered in Year 10, some students made it a personal target to get in as many dabs whilst she had her back turned. One chemistry table even had a risky competition between themselves to see who could get the most dabs by the end of the lesson.</p>
<p>Of course, since dabbing has been slowly phased out, the 'woah' has been a thing. Anyway, during this time the procrastinating 10J1 (now 11J1, although she has banished us to <a href="/teachers/mrs-wharmby">Mrs Wharmby</a> presumably because we are such an annoying class) decided to try and teach Mrs Stevenson-Jones how to do the woah. Since then, she has been sighted doing the woah in her classes, her form and even the 2020 German Exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>"Squeaky here has been diagnosed with laryngitis..."</h3>
<p>Many can't forget when Mrs Stevenson-Jones had laryngitis and despite all recommendations she decided to come in anyway and teach despite the fact she couldn't actually speak. This led to possibly some of the most entertaining chemistry lessons of 2019 as any content trying to be taught to us sounded like someone was trying to communicate it to a dog via dog whistle, or a nearby person was waving a squeaky gate hinge around for an hour.</p>

  <p>"(Something something something) and I went to the nail salon and decided to get plum purple nail polish and this woman at the salon was like 'do you want to see a cool trick?' and got out a magnet and put it on my nails and they changed colour! And I was like, whoo lets give my Year 10s a <a href="/other/homework">homework</a> all about why that happens and I was telling my dad all about it cause he was staying over for a few days... and you know what he said?? He said only half the class would be interested because the other half of the class are boys and then we had a bleepy argument and I would have probably punched him if we weren't in a pub."</p>

  <p>"This week I am glad to see that <a href="/teachers/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a> and the teachers are providing you with much material for the memes page (*rolls eyes*)" ~ lockdown email (not sure what she meant by the 'rolls eyes' part I bet she was thrilled to see the meme pages thriving)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The other thing I have been doing is to make a 3D model of a chameleon... which is exceptionally fiddly. As I have ZERO patience, I have been using superglue so my finger tips are mangled now and I keep finding bits of glue on my forearms. It looks good - better on one side than the other because I messed up one of the flaps."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"When you look up at the sky, what do you see? Perhaps, if you are sat in Chemistry, your dreams fluttering away as I drone on about hydrocarbons. Perhaps birds, perhaps planes, perhaps stars, or a nice sunrise or the moon - which has been looking glorious recently. Perhaps, if you look at the right time, the little flickering lights of the ISS. We live in the North. So also clouds. Sometimes nice white fluffy ones, sometimes imposing grey ones, rainclouds, thunderclouds; sometimes - if we are lucky - ones that bring us snow. And clouds, whatever their destiny, are made of...WATER VAPOUR!"</p>
