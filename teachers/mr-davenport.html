<h2>Mr Davenport</h2>
<p>Mr Davenport teaches music technology to Year 7s, and during other music lessons helps out with anything techy. He can also play any musical instrument he picks up and can play a pretty neat guitar song from the top of his head.</p>
<p>One time we had a music lesson with him after a fire alarm at lunch and he decided to make up a rock song about it. The lyrics went something like "All I wanted to do was eat my sandwich, my sandwich.... Everyone in the lunch line got free food and the dinner ladies were screaming 'give us our money', 'give us our money' and I just sat down and ate a sausage." It was actually a pretty good song that stuck in our form's heads all day.</p>
<p>He lets people eat in lesson and in a cover lesson let us do karaoke as it was the last day instead of Mr Webber's cover work.</p>
<h3>The Boy Who Lived</h3>
<p>Mr Davenport is likened to Grindelwald in his appearance. One time he came in with a scratch on his forehead and when asked about it he said that he had been battling Voldemort the night before which confirmed our suspicions. Although to another class he told them the scratch had been acquired after digging up graves and he had walked into a branch.</p>
<h3>His 'sexy voice'</h3>
<p>In Mr Webber's words, Mr Davenport's voice is indeed 'very sexy' which is why he features on all the Year 7, 8, and 9 music exams. Some highlights from his exams include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Hello and welcome to the Key Stage 3 Music Exam."</li>
  <li>"The song will now play twice more." (you could hear the Willy Wonka boat theme echoing all around school as everyone sat their exams at slightly different times - it was very surreal...)</li>
  <li>"You know have 20 minutes to complete the rest of the paper."</li>
  <li>"You have 5 minutes remaining, I repeat you have five minutes remaining."</li>
  <li>"That's the end of the exam, you may now chill out."</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I had a Harry Potter moment and fought Voldemort!"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Are you ready for your execution-- whoops, I mean exam!"</p>
