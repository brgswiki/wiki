<h2>Mrs Szafranski</h2>
<p>Mrs Szafranski was an <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> teacher, previously known as Miss Edge, and was definitely one of the more chill English department members. A lot of lessons ended up talking on a tangent but no one minded as long as it's not English related. She left at the end of the 2021 /22 school year.</p>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>Mrs Szafranski joined the English department in late 2016, mainly taking over teaching duties from Mr Overend. This meant she was handed his GCSE class. She realised that most of them had no idea what to do for GCSE and so she had to go into overdrive to teach them. It is fair to say that 2012 Intake owe their GCSE English grades to her.</p>
<h3>The Christmas Lessons</h3>
<p>Although her opinion on the actual holiday and festive season are unclear. Mrs Szafranski (or at least in her Ms Edge era) has a fascination with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhjOOEgqzjo">video</a> which she showed to us at least 14 times during the one Christmas she taught us. She also enjoys the remix and will play it to the class whilst giggling at her desk. It is quite odd.&nbsp;</p>
