<h2>Mrs Culshaw</h2>
<p>Mrs Culshaw was a supply teacher who joined halfway through the 2020/21 year to replace Mr Vincent and left at the end of that same year. She taught RS and was a fan of the Truman Show.</p>
<h3>Seychelles</h3>
<p>Miss Culshaw used to live in the African islands of Seychelles. She was the head of an international school on the island, and is thus an experienced linguist. Her and her child were friends with a number of millionaires and other rich people on the island. It is unknown if she returned to her beloved island home after leaving BRGS, after she stated she would like to (imagine choosing a tropical island over Lancashire!?).</p>
