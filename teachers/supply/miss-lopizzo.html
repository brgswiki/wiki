<h2>Miss Lopizzo</h2>
<p>She was an Italian cover teacher covering for <a href="/teachers/past/miss-forrest">Miss Forrest</a> when she had surgery, but she's that iconic that she needs mentioning. For example she once came into our lesson with only socks because her shoes were broken. Her favourite Italian meal is lasagna and when no cover work came for our lesson she showed us some pictures of Spanish hotels.</p>
<p>Her name is often mistaken for Miss Pizza, or Miss La Pizza.</p>
