<h2>Mr Blacoe</h2>
<p>Often seen with a coffee cup in hand, sporting a rather fine moustache.</p>
<p>Many pupils seem to agree on the fact he looks like the ticket collector on 'The Polar Express'. He also looks like the guy who has a moustache put on his face in the 'Money Supermarket' advert, and <a href="/teachers/miss-carney">Miss Carney</a> thinks he looks like a "wily old detective". He is a pretty nice casual guy, and he often comes up to his year 11 GCSE students to have a chat with them. His lessons are very interesting yet he slightly lacks interest in them, usually focusing on marking essays.</p>
<p>He seems to be BRGS' go-to supply <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> teacher and makes a return whenever one of them is on maternity leave. This year however, this esteemed title has been taken from him by <a href="/teachers/mr-foster">Mr Foster</a>.</p>
