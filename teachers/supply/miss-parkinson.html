<p>Miss Parkinson is an external cover teacher who comes in when BRGS is short-staffed and was one of the food technology maternity covers in the 2021 / 22 school year. She is very sassy and be warned, a lot of the things she says are on the cover lesson-plan usually aren't and are just more convenient for her. She is in fact <a href="/teachers/mrs-williamson">Mrs Williamson's</a> auntie.</p>
<p>She did charity work in Sudan and has stories for every occasion.</p>
<p>She described to one of her classes how she ‘only works in good schools’ and had decided to retire fully at the end of of the 2022 school year.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Student: Can we listen to music?</p>
  <p>Miss P: No because I don't have the contract which lets me let you listen to music. If a teacher were to walk in and you're all here with your earphones, they will tell other teachers, and I will never get hired here again. And I won't get any money, and I'm a widow. Such a poor, poor widow. And I wouldn't be able to feed my children, so they'll starve, and even though they don't live with me - they're 22 and 24. That's why you can't listen to music. Do you want my children to starve??</p>
  <p>Student: ...Debatable...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Miss Parkinson: Ok, your teacher said to complete the work in silence, and anything you hadn't finished would have to be done for homework.</p>
  <p>(At the end of the lesson after everyone has worked in silence for the first time in months)</p>
  <p>Miss Parkinson: I have a confession to make, I lied. Your teacher didn't really say that. Ha.</p>
