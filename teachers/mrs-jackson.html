<h2>Mrs Jackson</h2>
<p>Mrs Jackson is a <a href="/subjects/food-tech">food tech</a> &nbsp;and <a href="/subjects/textiles">textiles</a> teacher who supposedly retired at the end of the 2016/17 school year. The school, evidently not able to find another technology teacher of her quality, kept semi asking bringing her back for a year here and there. However, in 2019/2020, she came back full time (though if you ask her, she doesn't seem too happy) and now teaches textiles to Year 7s and food tech to Year 8s &amp; 9s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notably, she says a mix of 'scon' and 'scoan' and didn't even realise until someone asked which way she really though scone was really pronounced - to which she replied that she didn't even know anymore.</p>
