<p>Scottish History teacher who doesn't care about oracy sessions. Someone she didn't like forgot their reading book and she made them sing happy birthday to someones mum. She once told us in a cover lesson that if there was a plague outbreak she would steal resources to protect herself and <a href="/teachers/mr-grehan">Mr Grehan</a>, her husband. She and Mr Grehan apparently make the "dream team" yet drive different cars to work.</p>
<p>Always carries a thermos around supposedly full of coffee but once somebody spilt it and it was actually full of soup. Had my phone out when I wasn't meant to once. Terrifying. When she is annoyed with you will say your name three times, maybe there is a curse?</p>
