<h2>Mr Porteous</h2>
<p>Mr Porteous joined BRGS in 2012 as headteacher. He is husband to <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/teachers/mrs-porteous">Mrs Porteous</a> and since joining has indeed left quite an impression. He has done this through many ways the most significant being known as the headteacher who added all the extensions. No one is really sure why he has added all these extensions in his reign as there are other things the money could be spent on, but then again, who doesn't appreciate having 7 different ways to walk from the Clark Building to the English block.</p>
<h3>The Great Tomato Rescue</h3>

<p>During the 2019 Belgium trip, Mr Porteous rescued a tomato stress ball that rolled to the front of the coach. He himself described it as "Mr Porteous and the Great Tomato Rescue" and said "it could be a really massive thing". In addition to this, he also said "a complete illustrated children's book is all I'm after."</p>
<p>In fact, the story is growing so much that multiple TV channels have asked for television rights and there is now a large fan base demanding more media.</p>
<p>JK Rowling and a number of other authors have also expressed interest in writing a novel about The Great Tomato Rescue, and Tim Burton has asked for rights to make a film although Mr Porteous turned down the offer believing it would be too dark for the vibe he wanted to go for.</p>
