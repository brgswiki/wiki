<h2>Mr Seddon</h2>
<p>Mr Seddon is a member of SLT and a Maths teacher, and bears more than a passing resemblance to a certain Dr Robert Koch. His assemblies are quality and often revolve around his home restoration projects, Rocket League, or his time on Reddit.</p>
<p>Seddon is also a big Swiftie, but hasn’t seen Taylor’s “All Too Well” short film as he doesn’t like music videos.</p>
<p>He is well known for owning the best fashion sense going, with his waistcoats and jackets he is only one step away from a monocle.</p>
<h3>Ready Seddy Go</h3>
<p>For one of the Enrichment Week activities, he designed a code-breaking activity and after taking an hour or two for the class to decipher the page it turned out the message was all just jokes or famous movie lines such as 'what do you call a sleeping dinosaur? A dinosnore' and 'Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>The enraged class turned to <a href="/teachers/past/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a> and he said we were more than welcome to go and confront him. After a few people got up off their seats to go to Mr Seddon's office Mr Reeves quickly went 'nonono I meant after school'.&nbsp;</p>
