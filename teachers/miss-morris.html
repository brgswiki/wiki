<h2>Miss Morris</h2>
<p>Miss Morris is a <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> teacher and without doubt one of the nicest teachers at BRGS. She has a number of catchphrases such as 'ladles and jellyspoons' and is also the founder of <a href="/subjects/physics/physics-cat">Physics Cat</a>. Her memes are class and overshadow <a href="/other/meme-pages">the meme pages</a> by miles, her memes often revolve around physics, Rick Astley, tea and cats. In fact, her meme game is so fire that Mrs Taylor thought she ran one of the meme pages (well maybe she does, how would we know...?). Before she joined BRGS she decided it would be a good idea to read up about her soon-to-be colleagues on the old BRGS Wiki.</p>
<p>Miss Morris is also famed for her Doc Martens, one pair were in fact a gift from her good friends <a href="/teachers/ms-marti">Ms Marti</a> and <a href="/teachers/mrs-porteous">Mrs Porteous. </a>Other notable things about this friendship include winning the Shelfie Competition and apparently one time she and Mrs Porteous decided to trick the other staff members into believing Mr Porteous was a Love Island fan by taking pictures of him watching it (he was in fact asleep) and this led to Mrs Foster trying to start a conversation with him about it but he had no idea what she was talking about.</p>
<p>Do not say "heat rises" during any of her lessons unless you wish to be the first person to have 'death by physics teacher' written on their grave! This will be immediately ensued by a half hour rant about buckets of light or something (I swear it makes sense but I've just forgotten how).</p>

  <p>"I had a hypothesis that if teachers carried tasers then students would behave very differently. I asked <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a> what he thought, but the Governors wouldn't let us. However, a student of mine also said that if students carried tasers then the teachers would he a lot nicer."</p>

  <p>Student: DRUGS!</p>
  <p>Miss Morris: Of course, I wanted to, but Mr Porteous wouldn't allow me - he said it was unethical and it wasn't ethical to keep you up all night.</p>
