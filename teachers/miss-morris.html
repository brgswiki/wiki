<h2>Miss Morris</h2>
<p>Miss Morris is a <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> teacher and without doubt one of the nicest teachers at <a href="/groups/places/brgs">BRGS</a>. She has a number of catchphrases such as 'ladles and jellyspoons' and is also the founder of <a href="/subjects/physics/physics-cat">Physics Cat</a>. Her memes are class and overshadow <a href="/other/meme-pages">the meme pages</a> by miles, her memes often revolve around physics, Rick Astley, tea and cats. In fact, her meme game is so fire that <a href="/teachers/mrs-taylor">Mrs Taylor</a> thought she ran one of the meme pages (well maybe she does, how would we know...?). Before she joined BRGS she decided it would be a good idea to read up about her soon-to-be colleagues on the old BRGS Wiki.</p>
<p>Do not say "heat rises" during any of her lessons unless you wish to be the first person to have 'death by physics teacher' written on their grave! This will be immediately ensued by a half hour rant about buckets of light or something (I swear it makes sense but I've just forgotten the explanation).</p>
<h3>Physics With Morris</h3>
<p>Miss Morris makes her own videos to do with physics, as science students currently can't do any practicals as a result of 'rona. These are called 'Physics with Morris', or for her Year 8s which she has to teach biology too, 'Physics with Morris does biology'.</p>
<p>Her classes believe she should have her own Youtube channel and may give up teaching to become the next Bill Nye or Katrina Bryan.</p>

  <p>"Ladles and jellyspoons."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I had a hypothesis that if teachers carried tasers then students would behave very differently. I asked <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a> what he thought, but the Governors wouldn't let us. However, a student of mine also said that if students carried tasers then the teachers would he a lot nicer."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Miss Morris: We want to test reaction time and how they change--</p>
  <p>Student: DRUGS!</p>
  <p>Miss Morris: Of course, I wanted to, but Mr Porteous wouldn't allow me - he said it was unethical and it wasn't ethical to keep you up all night.</p>
