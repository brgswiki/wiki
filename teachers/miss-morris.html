<h2>Miss Morris</h2>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:28.99%;"><img src="/miss_morris.png"></figure>
<p>Miss Morris is a <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> teacher and without doubt one of the nicest teachers at <a href="/groups/places/brgs">BRGS</a>. She joined in September 2012, has a number of catchphrases such as 'ladles and jellyspoons', and is also the founder of <a href="/subjects/physics/physics-cat">Physics Cat</a>.</p>
<p>Her memes are class and overshadow <a href="/other/meme-pages">the meme pages</a> by miles, her memes often revolve around physics, Rick Astley, tea and cats. In fact, her meme game is so fire that <a href="/teachers/mrs-taylor">Mrs Taylor</a> thought she ran one of the meme pages (well maybe she does, how would we know...?). Before she joined BRGS she decided it would be a good idea to read up about her soon-to-be colleagues on the old BRGS Wiki.</p>
<p>Do not say "heat rises" during any of her lessons unless you wish to be the first person to have 'death by physics teacher' written on their grave! This will be immediately ensued by a half hour rant about buckets of light or something. (The last person to say this suffered the consequences of a bucket of cold water - with photographic evidence)</p>
<p>Every year for Christmas Miss Morris wears a festive string of fairy lights that seems to grow in length each year. Also for Christmas, in a compromise with her mother, Miss M will eat one brussel sprout - enough to make her mum happy, not enough to feel begrudging and resentful for the rest of the day.</p>
<h3>Physics With Morris</h3>
<p>Miss Morris makes her own videos to do with physics, as science students currently can't do any practicals as a result of ‘rona’. These are called 'Physics with Morris', or for her <a href="/students/intake19">Year 8</a>s which she has to teach <a href="/subjects/biology">biology</a> too, 'Physics with Morris does biology'.</p>
<p>Her classes believe she should have her own Youtube channel and may give up teaching to become the next Bill Nye or Katrina Bryan. Some members of her Y8 class even suggested a joint venture with one of <a href="/other/meme-pages">the memes pages</a>. (→We would be happy to oblige, our GCSEs are a lost cause anyway - [what GCSEs?])</p>
<p>She has little hope in her current <a href="/students/intake18">Year 9</a> group (understandably).</p>
<h3>Physics With Morris Does Biology</h3>
<p>She has asked for us to mention how good her biology is and how she could successfully label the muscle on the small intestine (we are indeed very proud).</p>
<h3>Physics with Morris does Physics/Cooking in her Kitchen</h3>
<p>She is looking for a theme tune if anyone feels so compelled…</p>
<p>Some of the guest appearances include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“One of my frying pans.”</li>
  <li>“A big spoon for stirring stews.”</li>
  <li>“A pan for if I'm frying eggs.”</li>
  <li>“METAL HANDLE.”</li>
  <li>“Spatula.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In her words the frying pan works well as a frying pan.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Look out for Little Chats with Morris, the new daytime talk show…</li>
</ul>
<h3>(Never?) Gonna Give You Up</h3>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:22.56%;"><img src="/rickroll.jpg"></figure>
<p>Miss Morris has taught her classes well - shaping them from the moment she began showing us Rick Astley pie charts. In fact, they have been taught so well there has been an increase in rick-rolls throughout the school - yet the most impactful no doubt being from her very own 11K1. First joining her physics Google Meet having all changed their profile picture to the same Rick Astley gif.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, on the chat suggesting she should check her wiki page - which had been masterfully changed to a redirect to the very video itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As if this wasn't enough, on the return to school there was more - dotted around the various classrooms of the Clark Building are now the (slightly demonic) printed out faces of Rick Astley which kindly watch over Year 11 lessons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In retaliation, Miss M has hinted at intending to just call all members of the class ‘Rick’ from now on. The Google Classroom header has also been topically changed.</p>
<p>Update: The Ricks are duplicating. No one is safe. A <a href="/teachers/miss-foster">certain geography teacher</a> has weighed in stating “I lived through the first Rick Astley era... We didn’t need a second one. (and upon seeing a Rick Astley face hanging from the ceiling tile beyond the height of easily being placed there) I blame exam stress.”</p>
<p>Update 2: With Year 11 drawing to a close, the final (until the next one) <a href="https://twitter.com/BRGS_Physics/status/1393174985078943747">ultimate Rick Roll</a> has taken place, and all we need now is for the man himself to acknowledge the masterful shenanigans.</p>
