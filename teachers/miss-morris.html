<p>Miss Morris is a physics teacher and without doubt one of the nicest teachers at BRGS. She has a number of catchphrases such as 'ladles and jellyspoons' and is also the founder of <a href="/subjects/physics/physics-cat">Physics Cat</a>. Her memes are class and overshadow <a href="/other/meme-pages">the meme pages</a> by miles, her memes are often revolve around physics, Rick Astley, tea and cats. In fact, her meme game is so fire that Mrs Taylor thought she ran one of the meme pages (maybe she does...)</p>
<p>Miss Morris is also famed for her Doc Martens, one pair were in fact a gift from her good friends <a href="/teachers/ms-marti">Ms Marti</a> and <a href="/teachers/mrs-porteous">Mrs Porteous.</a></p>
