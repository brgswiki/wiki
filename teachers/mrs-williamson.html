<h2>Mrs Williamson</h2>
<p>Mrs Williamson is a <a href="/subjects/pe">P.E.</a> teacher who was off on maternity leave in 2020. Despite being a P.E. teacher, she does not actually do any P.E. and just directs you, as most P.E. teachers do. If she likes your class or is your form tutor then at the end of the year she will give you legendary fudge that is known only to the elites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She is a pretty chill teacher but me and a friend were once just looking out of a window instead of doing P.E. and she stood behind us for a solid ten minutes listening to our conversation before telling us off. She only gives you set 1 in P.E. if you do the netball club. Can't count down from ten unless everybody is running.</p>
