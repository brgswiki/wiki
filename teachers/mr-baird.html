<h2>Mr Baird</h2>

</figure>
<p>Mr Baird is the Head of the <a href="/subjects/pe">PE</a> Department and is <i>very very </i>tall. He is considered the more relaxed out of the two male PE teachers. On <a href="/groups/trips/year-9-camp">Year 9 Camp</a> Mr Baird and <a href="/teachers/mr-wilkinson">Mr Wilkinson</a> took a bunch of selfies on <a href="/teachers/miss-gore-ward">Miss Gore-Ward</a>'s phone whilst she was on an activity and she keeps complaining that it keeps coming up as a memory on her phone.</p>
<h3>His Height</h3>
<p>Mr Baird is very tall. In fact he is so tall that he is 6 foot 7. You can always spot him on school photographs because he towers above the other staff members and probably hides the faces of anyone in the rows behind him.</p>

  <p>(Mr B running onto the astroturf)</p>
  <p>His PE students: (as a chanting song) MR B, MR B, WHERE ARE YOUR SHIN-PADS?</p>
  <p>Mr B: (nervous laughter) ermm... heh...</p>
