<h2>Mr Johnstone</h2>
<p>Mr Johnstone is the new deputy head following <a href="/teachers/past/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a>' retirement, starting his post in Sept 2021. Self proclaimed bad at basketball and addresses his classes with ‘little people’.</p>
<p>One fond anecdote states “he came in the other day, played rocket league for 30 seconds on someone's phone, then left".</p>
<h3>Home decor</h3>
<p>His office contains multiple objects which all together sum up his personality well:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dehydrated tiny spider plant in a massive plant pot</li>
  <li>2 confiscated water pistols</li>
  <li>A mug that says ‘Thanks for being the best teacher, Mr J!’ or something along those lines that he no doubt bought for himself on ebay</li>
  <li>Multiple hi-vises</li>
  <li>A book on the shelf of otherwise CGPs called ‘Gen Z, Explained’ (I personally think this is funniest thing)</li>
  <li>An empty sun bleached noticeboard that has been this way all year</li>
</ul>
<h3>Line of Succession</h3>
<p>Mr Reeves has expressed his blessing in the matter, raving about his successor's approachability and believing both students and staff will be easily able to talk to him.</p>
<h3>Rules are made to be broken?</h3>
<p>Anyone who has been at BRGS in the 2021-22 school year will soon realise Mr Johnstone is a stickler for rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His uniform list is a prized possession of his, although sadly no one has yet told him he has the wrong shade of trousers and his socks are too short, leaving us worrying about the impressionable Year 7s who will soon follow in his rebellious footsteps.</p>
<p>In his first few days he's been spotted wandering around the BRGS premises with a sheet of paper and pen, even stopping to make notes whilst intently staring at a tree sapling near the Clark Building, presumably somewhere in his office there is now a piece of paper that just says “to be chopped down” or “good hiding place to jump out and take phones off unsuspecting pupils".</p>
<p>Perhaps he will take a leaf out of the meme pages' book after seeing their April Fool’s prank and decide that BRGS does in fact need a uniform change, giving both lower school and sixth form a brand new fashion overhaul down to cloaks, hats, and clashing colour combinations.</p>
<h3>Hi-fashion</h3>
<p>It seems that Mr Johnstone only implements the aforementioned uniform rules so that no student can outshine his passion for fashion. After one term of blazers and suits he has changed his tune, and bought himself a luminous yellow hi vis.</p>
<p>In an attempt to try and make it look like he's started a new trend Mr Johnstone has bought all of SLT a hi vis, alongside any other staff who are on duty. Whilst this was originally meant to be compulsory fortunately one fashion-conscious staff member ensured that the fashionistas in the Teachers' Union put a quick stop to this.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Line - Where?</h3>
<p>Mr Johnstone is very reliant on using his ‘line’ on deciding whether a student should be punished or not. This line is arguably very wavy or changes position depending on his mood. Some clues as to where the enigmatic line may be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“You've crossed the line.” - for making flippant remarks about the school's achievement record</li>
  <li>“I reread your article properly and I don't think you have crossed the line, but you've come very close.” - for making flippant remarks about the school's achievement record</li>
  <li>“You're toeing the line.” - again, for making flippant remarks</li>
  <li>“Sir, why did you give up trying to find the meme pages then start all over again a few months later?” “Because you crossed the line.” - to this day I don't know which line we crossed, he refuses to elaborate</li>
  <li>“You've leapt over the line.” - upon being called a paedo for not wearing his lanyard, which arguably follows what we were told to do in assembly</li>
  <li>“<i>That</i> would have been crossing the line.” - should someone have stolen his hi-vis from his office.</li>
</ul>
