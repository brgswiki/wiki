<h2>Mr Johnstone</h2>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:26.18%;"><img src="/mr_johnstone2.png"></figure>
<p>Mr Johnstone is the new deputy head following <a href="/teachers/past/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a>' retirement, starting his post in Sept 2021. Self proclaimed bad at basketball and addresses his classes by ‘little people’.</p>
<p>He beat (perhaps the only other) candidate Ms Kayne to the post, although this was possibly only down the fact she seemed to keep losing her tour guide and maybe never made it back to <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a>' <a href="/groups/rooms/office/19">office</a> to accept the job, perhaps even to this day she remains lost, wandering in and around both BRGS and the surrounding Waterfoot landscape.</p>
<h3>Line of Succession</h3>
<p>Mr Reeves has expressed his blessing in the matter, raving about his successor's approachability and believing both students and staff will be easily able to talk to him. Students are not so sure; assemblies of Paw Patrol, making pancakes for classes, and coming in to form rooms singing* are not easily forgotten, let alone beaten.</p>
<p>*considered essential to be deputy head</p>
<h3>Rules are made to be broken?</h3>
<p>Anyone who has been at BRGS in the 2021-22 school year will soon realise Mr Johnstone is a stickler for rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within his first 2 days he has already implemented a war on phones and uniform with no backing down. His uniform list with exact measurements is a prized possession of his, although sadly no one has yet told him he has the wrong shade of trousers and his socks are too short, leaving us worrying about the impressionable Year 7s who will soon follow in his rebellious footsteps.</p>
<p>When (there is no ‘if’) he is telling you off he smiles the entire the entire time, which is mildly unsettling to say the least.</p>
<p>In his first few days he's been spotted wandering around the BRGS premises with a sheet of paper and pen, even stopping to make notes whilst intently staring at a tree sapling near the Clark Building, presumably somewhere in his office there is now a piece of paper that just says “to be chopped down” or “good hiding place to jump out and take phones off unsuspecting pupils".</p>
<p>Whilst he has discovered the meme pages (and unfortunately not in favour of them) it is possible he will take a leaf out of their book after seeing their April Fool’s prank and decide that BRGS does in fact need a uniform change, and give both lower school and sixth form a brand new fashion overhaul down to cloaks, hats, and painful colour combinations.</p>
