<h2>Mr Johnstone</h2>
<p>Mr Johnstone is the new deputy head following <a href="/teachers/past/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a>' retirement, starting his post in Sept 2021. Not much is known about the fellow yet other than his trial lesson/assembly(?) was about 'duty' (sadly, no acronyms in sight) and he got us out of ½ hour of <a href="/subjects/pe">PE</a> by chatting to <a href="/teachers/mrs-kolbuck">Mrs Kolbuck</a> so I personally can't complain on that front.</p>
<p>He beat (perhaps the only other) candidate Ms Kayne to the post, although this was possibly only down the fact she seemed to keep losing her tour guide and maybe never made it back to <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a>' <a href="/groups/rooms/office/19">office</a> to accept the job, perhaps even to this day she remains lost, wandering in and around both BRGS and the surrounding Waterfoot landscape.</p>
<p>He’s either Scottish or Irish - no one can really agree.</p>
<h3>Line of Succession</h3>
<p>Mr Reeves has expressed his blessing in the matter, raving about his successor's approachability and believing both students and staff will be easily able to talk to him. Students are not so sure; assemblies of Paw Patrol, making pancakes for classes, and coming in to form rooms singing* are not easily forgotten, let alone beaten.</p>
<p>*considered essential to be deputy head</p>
