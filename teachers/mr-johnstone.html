<p>Mr Johnstone is the new deputy head following <a href="/teachers/past/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a>' retirement, starting his post in Sept 2021. Self proclaimed bad at basketball and addresses his classes with ‘little people’.</p>
<p>Some pupils wonder if his first name is John, meaning his full name would be John Johnstone as on his office door, it says J.Johnstone. This, although extremely entertaining for BRGS pupils, would be very unfortunate for Mr Johnstone himself.</p>
<p>He beat (perhaps the only other) candidate Ms Kayne to the post, although this was possibly only down the fact she seemed to keep losing her tour guide and maybe never made it back to <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a>' <a href="/groups/rooms/office/19">office</a> to accept the job, perhaps even to this day she remains lost, wandering in and around both BRGS and the surrounding Waterfoot landscape.</p>
<p>One fond anecdote states “he came in the other day, played rocket league for 30 seconds on someone's phone, then left".</p>
<h3>Line of Succession</h3>
<p>Mr Reeves has expressed his blessing in the matter, raving about his successor's approachability and believing both students and staff will be easily able to talk to him. Students remain wary; assemblies of Paw Patrol, making pancakes for classes, and coming in to form rooms singing* are not easily forgotten, let alone beaten.</p>
<p>*considered essential to be deputy head</p>
<h3>Rules are made to be broken?</h3>
<p>Anyone who has been at BRGS in the 2021-22 school year will soon realise Mr Johnstone is a stickler for rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within his first 2 days he has already implemented a war on phones and uniform with no backing down. His uniform list with exact measurements is a prized possession of his, although sadly no one has yet told him he has the wrong shade of trousers and his socks are too short, leaving us worrying about the impressionable Year 7s who will soon follow in his rebellious footsteps.</p>
<p>When (there is no ‘if’) he is telling you off he smiles the entire the entire time, which is mildly unsettling to say the least.</p>
<p>In his first few days he's been spotted wandering around the BRGS premises with a sheet of paper and pen, even stopping to make notes whilst intently staring at a tree sapling near the Clark Building, presumably somewhere in his office there is now a piece of paper that just says “to be chopped down” or “good hiding place to jump out and take phones off unsuspecting pupils".</p>
<p>Whilst he has discovered the meme pages (and outwardly not in favour of them, however we have no doubt he puts up the ‘meeting in progress’ sign on his door just so he can sit in his office refreshing the meme pages undisturbed to stay up to date) it is possible he will take a leaf out of their book after seeing their April Fool’s prank and decide that BRGS does in fact need a uniform change, and give both lower school and sixth form a brand new fashion overhaul down to cloaks, hats, and clashing colour combinations.</p>
<h3>Zumos</h3>
<p>He has also found a mental health website called Zumos (wherever he dug up said website is a complete mystery) which is now what he <i>hopes</i> to be an established part of BRGS life, where every morning (except for assemblies) your form tutor is <i>supposed</i> to play a ‘How to be Happy’ video from Zumos. Various advice on ‘How to be Happy’ so far includes being kind, saying no and snarling in front of a mirror. There are many functions on Zumos, such as a Games Room, Power quizzes, a Life Book and Life tracker (which does not sound creepy at all).</p>
<h3>Hi-fashion</h3>
<p>It seems that Mr Johnstone only implements such strict uniform rules so that no student can outshine his passion for fashion. After one term of blazers and suits he has changed his tune, and bought himself a luminous yellow hi vis. (Whilst he claims this is for safeguarding I have no doubt this is just to stop him being constantly being mistaken for a Y11.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an attempt to try and make it look like he's started a new trend Mr Johnstone has bought all of SLT a hi vis, alongside any other staff who are on duty. Whilst this was originally meant to be compulsory fortunately one fashion-conscious staff member ensured that the fashionistas in the Teachers' Union put a quick stop to this.&nbsp;</p>
