<p>Mrs Spencer is a <a href="/subjects/biology">biology</a> teacher who no matter your efforts - you could be Attenborough level - will still probably give you below target in your ATLs. She is also wife to none other than <a href="/teachers/mr-spencer">Mr Spencer</a>.</p>
<p>Mrs Spencer is also one of the staff cooks at the infamous <a href="/groups/trips/year-9-camp">Year 9 Camp</a>.</p>
<h3>Hats &amp; Spencers</h3>
<p>If you go back through the BRGS Website archives and into some of the old Paris photos, you can find numerous images of the Spencers in a wide range of hats.</p>
