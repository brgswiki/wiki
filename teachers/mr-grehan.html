<p>Mr Grehan is a history teacher and one of the bald gang. He is a head of year (8) and married to <a href="/teachers/mrs-grehan">Mrs Grehan</a>. Him and his wife are, according to him, the dream team, however drive different cars to work. Compared a whole year to Nazis. He is usually a very happy man but scary when angry (gets angry if you fight). He is also obsessed with oil on fire.</p><figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:30.06%;"><img src="/mr-grehan.jpg"><figcaption>Mr Grehan sporting a lovely hat</figcaption></figure><p>He is involved with a food bank charity and kindly lets his office be used for the collection point.</p><h2>Quotes</h2><blockquote><p>"Its like when the Nazis made Jews clean the street with toothbrushes!"
