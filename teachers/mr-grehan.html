<h2>Mr Grehan</h2>
<p>Mr Grehan is a history teacher and is head of <a href="/students/intake18">year 10</a> and married to <a href="/teachers/mrs-grehan">Mrs Grehan</a>. Him and his wife are, according to him, 'the dream team'. Once compared a whole year to Nazis. He is usually a very happy man but scary when angry (he gets angry if you fight). He is also obsessed with oil on fire. His sense of humour may be distasteful, however, if you look beyond this, you will discover a really sound, top notch guy. He is also a fan of West Ham united&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is an expert on modern Russian history, and teaches Tudor England at A-level. He believes that Lenin was responsible for the collapse of the USSR and for some reason, really likes Mikhail Gorbachev. In year 9, he usually teaches the industrial revolution, and is quite sensitive towards the sufferings of 19th century factory workers. He also teaches about Jack the Ripper which can either be sadistically fascinating or absolutely abominable for the students. During this topic he puts on the weirdest, gory videos and hands out printed images of mutilated corpses which he is lowkey enjoys.</p>
<p>His teaching methods include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Going off on 20 minute historical rambles</li>
  <li>Setting multiple pages of booklet to be completed independently or in class</li>
  <li>Putting on David Starkey documentaries which are paused every 6 minutes</li>
  <li>Getting students to research stuff themselves and give presentations</li>
  <li>MASSOLIT!!!!</li>
</ul>
