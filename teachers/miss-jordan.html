<h2>Miss Jordan</h2>
<p>Miss Jordan is Head of English. She does not appreciate people racing down the stairs instead of being in lesson like they're supposed to be. She runs a lovely diverse book club and has a never-ending funky shirt collection. Known to be very meticulous and has great pride in having the nicest classroom displays. Never ask her to draw a tree.&nbsp;</p>
