<h2>Mrs Workman</h2>
<p>Mrs Workman is a <a href="/subjects/drama">drama</a> teacher who joined BRGS last year to replace <a href="/teachers/past/mrs-fowler-gibbs">Mrs Fowler-Gibbs</a>. Despite only being here a short while she has fortunately pretty much already completely rewritten the lower school's drama curriculum and changed all of the PowerPoints. However, she has also adopted the SFG's 'no drinking vessels in <a href="/groups/rooms/drama/94">Room 94</a>' rule.</p>
