<h2>Miss Wilkes</h2>
<p>Miss Wilkes is a <a href="/subjects/mfl">language</a> teacher that resembles Dora The Explorer, except a lot meaner and with longer skirts. She does not like you if you breathe in her lesson, or if you talk when not asked, or when you dance to a Just Dance, or if you are a student. However she does not give penalty points. Just don't look at the wrong bit in a textbook even though she didn't tell you what bit to look at.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In lessons, she doesn't know many peoples' names and therefore if she wants you to answer a question she just looks in your direction and maybe gives a slight nod of her head, however this leads to about half the class thinking she meant them and then her getting annoyed when no one knows who she meant. It was thought she was trying to give us a message in morse code through blinking but then this theory quickly fell apart when people realised she indeed does not blink and just bares a continuous withering stare. Miss Wilkes is fully aware of her reputation and rather than making any attempt to change it she has embraced it and just made her power stronger.</p>
<p>She is also a head of sixth form (which may explain why many people like BRGS Sixth Form considerably less that their lower years). She is often seen checking all the sixth formers for lanyards. She likes David Bowie, Spanish food, English PowerPoints, cats and textbooks in no particular order. Her eyes will look into your soul. You have been warned.</p>
<h3>The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Miss Wilkes</h3>
<p>Miss Wilkes is not all bad however, she just likes to establish a reputation with her classes at the start of the year so you don’t mess around in her lessons. She has been known on rare occasions to talk about her cat(s?), and on even rarer occasions let her classes turn the classroom into a hexbug arena (courtesy of Mr Fitton) rather than do Spanish.</p>
