<h2>Miss Butterworth</h2>
<p>Miss Butterworth is an RS and PSHCE teacher who teaches a lot in <a href="/groups/rooms/rs/24">Room 24</a>. She, like multiple other teachers, went to <a href="/groups/places/brgs">BRGS</a> as a student and says if she were to become a ghost she would definitely haunt BRGS.</p>
<p>One time when she was supposed to be doing a <a href="/subjects/german">German</a> cover, some students realised their <a href="/subjects/art">art</a> homework was due next lesson and they hadn't even started it yet. Instead of making the class do the cover work she made everyone help them finish their art homework in time.</p>
