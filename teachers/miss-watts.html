<h2>Miss Watts</h2>
<p>Miss Watts is the newest member of the <a href="/subjects/art">art</a> department. Like many art teachers, Miss Watts is no small fan of silence, and WWW and EBI. She actually lets you in instead of forcing you to wait outside on the steps and catch hypothermia like the other art teachers.</p>
