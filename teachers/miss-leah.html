<h2>Miss Leah</h2>
<p>Miss Leah is a <i>very </i>sarcastic geography teacher and is in fact possibly one of BRGS' funniest teachers. If you have a nice class then geography with Miss Leah is actually one of the funnest lessons. She likes to call people 'numpties' whenever they say something dumb.</p>
<h3>The Panda Incident of '19</h3>
<p>During one Intake 16 lesson in 2019 it was discovered that Miss Leah has a deep and undying hatred for pandas. Some of her reasons for this loathing include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"<strong>THEY CAN'T EVOLVE!!"</strong></li>
  <li>(pitch increasing) <i><strong>"THEY DO IVF FOR PANDAS BECAUSE THEY <u>CANNOT</u> BE BOTHERED TO REPRODUCE THEMSELVES." "WHY?? WHY?? BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY!"</strong></i></li>
  <li><i><strong>"<u>THEY WON'T EVEN EAT ANY FOOD THAT'S BEEN TOUCHED BY HUMANS!"</u></strong></i></li>
</ul>
<p>No one is really sure where this hatred came from although some believe that as a child she may have fallen into a giant panda enclosure, not dissimilar to the scene in Harry Potter where Dudley falls through the disappearing glass and ends up in the snake tank.</p>
<p>Some bright sparks have even noticed that a couple of teachers seem to have something against our bear friends, with Mr Flynn and <a href="/teachers/mrs-stevenson-jones">Mrs Stevenson-Jones</a> both disliking polar bears, and Miss Leah disliking pandas... is there a connection?</p>
<h3>Spiderwoman?</h3>
<p>A particular class was once just chatting to Miss Leah about her hobbies and one of which was 'climbing' alongside walking, sewing, and reading. The class thought nothing of it until one observant student noticed that there was a gluestick on a ledge halfway up the wall, far out of reach from any normal human.</p>
<p>Upon asking her about it Miss Leah quickly changed the subject back to geography and told the student not to ask such silly questions (as we were supposed to be working in silence).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I hate Lord of the Rings, it's way too long and it's like 90% Elvish songs, it's the only book I've never read fully because there are way too many Elvish songs. Like Tolkien could have literally written 'They sang fullstop' but oh no, he went and wrote 30 pages of choruses and verses of songs about elves!"</p>

  <p>Miss Leah: Always do your work in black or blue pen and your diagrams in pencil <i>no matter what Mr Fitton says.</i></p>

  <p>Student: Miss, why is this part of the map grey?</p>
