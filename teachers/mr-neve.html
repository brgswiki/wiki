<h2>Mr Neve</h2>
<p>Mr Neve is Head of the <a href="/subjects/drama">Drama</a> department (it is worth mentioning this department is only made up of 2 staff members including Mr Neve). His lessons are very diverse and often include things like replicating zombie apocalypses whereas <a href="/teachers/mrs-workman">Mrs Workman</a> and <a href="/teachers/past/mrs-fowler-gibbs">Mrs Fowler-Gibbs</a> tend to go for more Shakespeare themed topics. Like all the other drama teachers, he doesn't like having water in his classroom - maybe all drama teachers are like the witch in the Wizard of Oz?</p>
<h3>Time flies</h3>
<p>Mr Neve doesn't spend much time looking at a clock, sending a number of emails or messages on google classroom well into the afternoon or evening that often start with “Good morning!” or end with “Enjoy your morning!” - perhaps he is taking ‘time is a social construct’ to the next level.</p>
