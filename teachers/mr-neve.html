<h2>Mr Neve</h2>
<p>Mr Neve is Head of the Drama department (it is worth mentioning this department is only made up of 2 staff members including Mr Neve). His lessons are very diverse and often include things like replicating zombie apocalypses whereas <a href="/teachers/mrs-workman">Mrs Workman</a> and <a href="/teachers/past/mrs-fowler-gibbs">Mrs Fowler-Gibbs</a> tend to go for more Shakespeare themed topics. Like all the other drama teachers, he doesn't like having water in his classroom - maybe all drama teachers are like the witch in the Wizard of Oz?</p>
