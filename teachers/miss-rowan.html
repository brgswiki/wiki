<h2>Miss Rowan</h2>
<p>Miss Rowan is a <a href="/subjects/french">French</a> and <a href="/subjects/spanish">Spanish</a> teacher who likes to make use of Quizlet (especially Quizlet Live during Lockdown). She joined at the start of the 2019/2020 school year and is one of those teachers that are great to wake you up Monday P1 - the kind that likes songs, games and running around the classroom.</p>
<p>It's quite obvious she prefers Spanish (but teaches both of her languages with the same energy). Understandable, as the once lived in and taught <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> in Spain for a number of years.</p>
