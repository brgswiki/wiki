<h2>Miss Rowan</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/misss_rowan.png"></figure>
<p>Miss Rowan is a <a href="/subjects/french">French</a> and <a href="/subjects/spanish">Spanish</a> teacher who likes to make use of Quizlet (especially Quizlet Live during Lockdown). She joined at the start of the 2019/2020 school year and is one of those teachers that are great to wake you up Monday P1 - the kind that likes songs, games and running around the classroom.</p>
<p>It's quite obvious she prefers Spanish (but teaches both of her languages with the same energy). Understandable, as the once lived in and taught <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> in Spain for a number of years.</p>
<p>She is from Liverpool (shows in her accent) and is a strong Everton fan.</p>
<h3>Games</h3>
<h3>Songs</h3>
<p>As with her games, Miss Rowan loves to use songs throughout her lessons (many of which are conjugations of verbs). Here are a few of her favorites…</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ03KjwiIVM">J'aime les fruits</a> (I like fruit)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAOHRL843IY">Conjugation of Aller</a> (So much better than the name makes it sound)&nbsp;</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kWwS1_Kark">Conjugation of Avoir</a> (To the theme of Pink Panther)</li>
</ul>
