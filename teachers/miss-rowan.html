<h2>Miss Rowan</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/misss_rowan.png"></figure>
<p>Miss Rowan was a <a href="/subjects/french">French</a> and <a href="/subjects/spanish">Spanish</a> teacher who likes to make use of Quizlet (especially Quizlet Live during Lockdown). She joined at the start of the 2019/2020 school year and is one of those teachers that are great to wake you up Monday P1 - the kind that likes songs, games and running around the classroom.</p>
<p>Supposedly, she likes both her languages equally, (but some students swear she prefers Spanish, as she once lived in and taught <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> in Spain for a number of years) but it is true she teaches both languages with the same energy.</p>
<p>She is from Liverpool (shows in her accent) and, being a lover of football, is a strong Everton fan. She’s also a really based feminist, which can be shown through her enthusiasm in teaching the a level course which involves a lot of gender equality.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Games</h3>
<p>Quick note - most of these games aren’t names and my imagination is terrible so I’m sorry for the bad names…</p>
<h5>The Frog Game</h5>
<p>Quite possibly the most famous and most loved of her games, the frog game includes the following..</p>
<ol>
  <li>A word or phrase in Spanish/French or English will come up on the screen</li>
  <li>Everyone in class will have to translate it on whiteboards to the other language</li>
  <li>Meanwhile Kermit the Frog will travel across the screen towards his pond whilst the intro to <a href="https://youtu.be/VHoT4N43jK8">alors on danse</a> is playing</li>
  <li>The aim is to have your translation completed by the time Kermit reaches his pond</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, due to the game becoming so popular, a video game, board game and a special edition episode of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppet_Show?wprov=sfti1">the muppets</a> is planned to be coming out within the next year and a memorial to the frog game in Liverpool is due to be revealed sometime soon.</p>
<h5>French/Spanish Ping Pong</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Repeating Game</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Pictures corresponding with each word of vocab will be on the screen</li>
  <li>Miss will point at a picture on the screen and say some French/Spanish</li>
  <li>If the word that Miss said means the same as the picture, the class will repeat the French/Spanish</li>
  <li>If the word that Miss said doesn’t mean the same as the picture, and anyone repeats her, then miss gets a point. If the room stays silent, then the class gets a point.</li>
</ol>
<p>Miss Rowan really hates losing this game. I mean really, but there are usually reward points for the whole class if they win.</p>
<h5>Changez!</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Points Equal Prizes</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Musical Sentences</h5>
<ol>
  <li>The class will be split in three or four person groups, with each person having a whiteboard</li>
  <li>The music will start playing and each person will start to write a sentence in French/Spanish</li>
  <li>When the music stops, you have to swap your whiteboard with someone else in your group</li>
  <li>Each person will continue the sentence on their new board that was started by someone else in their group</li>
  <li>This continues until you have some really weird sentences appearing on people's boards, such as ‘At the weekend, I went to Paris and ate my brother in a hospital. Also, I did skiing at the beach.'</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Songs</h3>
<p>As with her games, Miss Rowan loves to use songs throughout her lessons (many of which are conjugations of verbs) and just has a great taste of foreign songs in general. Here are a few of her favorites…</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ03KjwiIVM">J'aime les fruits</a> (I like fruit)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAOHRL843IY">Conjugation of Aller</a> (So much better than the name makes it sound)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kWwS1_Kark">Conjugation of Avoir</a> (To the theme of Pink Panther)</li>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/VHoT4N43jK8">Alors on Danse</a> (Only made famous, of course, due to the frog game)</li>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/K5KAc5CoCuk">Derniere Danse</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://youtube.com/c/TherapieTAXI">Therapie Taxi</a> (Not a song, but a band)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reward Points</h3>
<p>As a true lover of the <a href="/other/behaviour-for-learning-policy">reward points system</a>, she has created her own way of deciding who gets points each lesson.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Whiteboard</h4>
<p>Answer a question (of varying difficulty), or translate her instructions (as most language teachers, she likes giving her instructions in the language she is teaching) during her class to earn a tick on the whiteboard. Get 4/5/6 ticks (depending on how kind she is feeling) and you bag yourself a reward point. Most pupils agree this is a great way to dish out reward points, and think other language teachers should embrace this method (<i>hint hint</i>).&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Other Ways to Earn</h4>
<p>Although the previous paragraph details her main means, there are also a range of different ways to earn yourself a reward point in her lessons. Here are some of them -&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Win a Competition (Individual and Team - the most RPs she has given out in a single competition is 25 (spread across a team))</li>
  <li>Smile at Her</li>
  <li>Be in her Form (For some reason, <a href="/students/intake19/w">19W</a> always seem to have the most reward points in the year)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Écoute et répète</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What happens if you choose German</h3>
<p>If in Year 8 you choose German over Spanish/French, then she <s>will seem incredibly upset</s> will try very hard to make you reconsider. It's recommended you choose French/Spanish as you may then get even more reward points.</p>
