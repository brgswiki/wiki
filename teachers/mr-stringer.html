<h2>Mr Stringer</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/mr_stringer.png"></figure>
<p>Mr Stringer is a <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> teacher and teaches a lot in Room 63. He uses a lot of idioms that no one has ever heard of and it is rumoured he just makes them up. Mr Stringer was a well educated young soul, reading Stephen Hawking's works in as early as Year 10. He knows a (concerning) number of radio station wavelengths. Some say he looks uncannily like <a href="/teachers/mr-peat">Mr Peat</a>, some say they are the same person - I'm not saying anything but we are yet see them together in the same Google Meet…</p>
<p>He is also <a href="/students/intake17/w">10W</a>'s form tutor.</p>
