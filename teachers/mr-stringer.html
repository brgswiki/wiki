<h2>Mr Stringer</h2>
<p>Mr Stringer is a <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> teacher and teaches a lot in Room 63. He says every lesson that he will put his classes in practical groups but now it's been a year and we can still work with whoever we want for practicals. Whilst people were working he put on ocean sounds although that was probably counter productive. He does not appreciate being called a Tory because he always wears blue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite it being the last day before school closed for corona he was the only teacher who still made us still do work.</p>
