<h2>Mr Stringer</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/mr_stringer.png"></figure>
<p>Mr Stringer is a <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> teacher and teaches a lot in Room 63. He says every lesson that he will put his classes in practical groups but now it's been a year and we can still work with whoever we want for practicals. Whilst people were working he put on ocean sounds although that was probably counter productive. He does not appreciate being called a Tory because he always wears blue. He uses a lot of idioms that no one has ever heard of and it is likely he just makes them up.</p>
<p>He is also 10W's form tutor.</p>
