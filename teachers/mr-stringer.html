<h2>Mr Stringer</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/mr_stringer.png"></figure>
<p>Mr Stringer is a <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> teacher and teaches a lot in Room 63. He uses a lot of idioms that no one has ever heard of and it is rumoured he just makes them up. Mr Stringer was a well educated young soul, reading Stephen Hawking's works in as early as Year 10. He knows a (perhaps concerning) number of radio station wavelengths. Some say he looks uncannily like <a href="/teachers/mr-peat">Mr Peat</a>, some say they are the same person - I'm not saying anything but we are yet see them together in the same Google Meet… Stringer is more than happy about the comparison but Mr Peat denies the resemblance (which is a total cover).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has a lot to say about Disney princesses and flowers (only good things).</p>
<p>He is also <a href="/students/intake17/w">10W</a>'s form tutor.</p>
<h3>Joseph and the Amazing Navy Dreamcoat</h3>
<p>Mr Stringer likes navy blue garments - and hopes to one day perhaps expand his horizons and extend his wardrobe into grey once he’s a little more daring, but for now however remains chasing after the navy jackets of his dreams. It is important to note this navy attire remains constant even on non uniform days. Owns 5 pairs of shoes.</p>
<h3>xoxo Gossip Teacher</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“Mr Stringer pretends he's not interested in the staffroom gossip, but he totally is. He'll sit there pretending he's not listening then all of a sudden just join in with something. He doesn't really know much gossip himself but he'll still join in.” ~ Mrs W</li>
  <li>The man himself would like to say in his defence that ‘it’s hard not to join in with gossip that's like 2 feet away.'</li>
  <li>The plot thickens - upon telling his fellow gossiper this excuse she would like to say “Shut up! That is such a lie! We'll be sat there in like literal silence and Mr Stringer will just start telling us all this gossip."</li>
  <li>“Mr Stringer was telling us how he was a total gossip girl in high school - if there was gossip, he knew it.”</li>
  <li>“Oh yeah he's one of the girls now… like his chair was fully pulled up in the staffroom gossip today…"</li>
</ul>
