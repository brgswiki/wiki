<h2>Miss Ingham</h2>
<p>Miss Ingham is an <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> teacher who left after the 2016/17 school year. The year after, during the Blackpool trip, we saw her again with her new school. She didn't even recognise her <a href="/students/intake16/s">old form</a> until she saw her old BRGS colleagues on the trip. For another two years she remained elusive and unseen, before returning again in the 2019/20 school year as an English teacher... again!</p>
<p>She has a number of different themed skirts, perhaps one for every day of the year. These are often matched to the day eg. black cat skirt on Halloween, Mickey Mouse skirts on <a href="/groups/trips/paris">Paris</a> trip.</p>
