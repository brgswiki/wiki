<h2>Miss Ingham</h2>
<p>Miss Ingham is an <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> teacher who left after the 2016/17 school year. The year after, during the Blackpool trip, we saw her again with her new school. She didn't even recognise her <a href="/students/intake16/s">old form</a> until she saw her old BRGS colleagues on the trip. For another two years she remained elusive and unseen, before returning again in the 2019/20 school year as an English teacher... again!</p>
<p>She has a number of different themed skirts, perhaps one for every day of the year. These are often matched to the day eg. black cat skirt on Halloween, Mickey Mouse skirts on <a href="/groups/trips/paris">Paris</a> trip. She has now upped her game even further and has matching masks to her skirts. It is unlikely you will see her wearing the same skirt twice, and it is wondered how large her wardrobe actually is.</p>
