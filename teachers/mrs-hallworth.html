<h2>Mrs Hallworth</h2>
<p>Mrs Hallworth is a psychology teacher and (I quote) “literally the nicest teacher ever.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>One fond memory told is “she squirted me and another student with the eye wash shower head thing in the science rooms.”</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>(Every week) “No I'm not coming to the pub with you tonight, that's weird.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Student: (asks a question)</p>
  <p>Mrs Hallworth: Ummm I'm not too sure… I'm not gonna lie I haven't done this topic in a while… I'll google it for you for next lesson.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If everyone else has a wiki page calling them a pedo I may as well join in.”</p>
