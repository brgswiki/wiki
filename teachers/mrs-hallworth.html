<h2>Mrs Hallworth</h2>
<p>Mrs Hallworth is a psychology teacher and (I quote) “literally the nicest teacher ever”. She is by far the most progressive and inclusive teacher at BRGS, and has displays in her classroom about important topics such as how to use new pronouns.</p>
<p>One fond memory told is “she squirted me and another student with the eye wash shower head thing in the science rooms.”</p>
<p>When she gets sad, she eats lasagne.</p>

  <p>”Let that be a lesson to all of you. I don’t know what that lesson is - but anyway…”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>”I had to look after <i>the most stupid dog</i>. His name was Bob and I played ‘Who Let The Dogs Out?’ for 4 months when I was about to feed him and he didn’t learn that when I played the song he was supposed to come running. Now whenever I hear that song all I can think of is Bob, and what’s even worse is that Spotify thinks I really like it - it was like my most played song last year.”</p>

  <p>“I always carry sugar water on my keys just in case I see a dying bee.”</p>

  <p>Mrs Hallworth: Ummm I'm not too sure… I'm not gonna lie I haven't done this topic in a while… I'll google it for you for next lesson.</p>
