<h2>Mrs Hallworth</h2>
<p>Mrs Hallworth is a psychology teacher and (I quote) “literally the nicest teacher ever”. She is by far the most progressive and inclusive teacher at BRGS, and has displays in her classroom about important topics such as how to use new pronouns.</p>
<p>One fond memory told is “she squirted me and another student with the eye wash shower head thing in the science rooms.”</p>
<p>When she gets sad, she eats lasagne.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>(Every week) “No I'm not coming to the pub with you tonight, that's weird.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Student: (asks a question)</p>
  <p>Mrs Hallworth: Ummm I'm not too sure… I'm not gonna lie I haven't done this topic in a while… I'll google it for you for next lesson.</p>

  <p>“Don’t interrupt me about a hole-punch, I’m trying to talk about the gays!”</p>
