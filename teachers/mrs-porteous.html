<p>Mrs Porteous is Head of <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/students/intake15">Year 11</a> and a biology teacher. She is also wife to none other than <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a> himself. One time she let us watch Twilight because it has that one 30 second scene about the science teacher talking about mitosis in the background and so therefore was considered educational.</p>
<h3>The Porteous Family</h3>

<p>To anyone who has experience more than one lesson with her, you could probably write a book about the Porteii family, as most lessons are spent discussing anecdotes that loosely link to the topic (for example, when telling us how to write a six marker, Mrs P instead told us her mum's recipe for cheese sauce and how she came across it). Of course, no one really minds these stories as they are a wonderful way to relieve the amount of biology. After hearing about the Porteous Family through many recounts, it can be concluded that there are many similarities with the Addams Family. And although Alan is no Gomez Addams, the sheer size of extended family can be compared to that of the Addams clan, and the stories behind them all.</p>
<h4>The Porteous Curse</h4>
<p>Following the theme, during the <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/students/intake16">Year 10</a> disease topic, it was discovered that many of the people Mrs Porteous knew had died strange or unusual deaths... Acquaintances of Mrs Porteous you have been warned...</p>
<h3>The Next David Attenborough?</h3>
<p>During the lockdown, when we were studying plant defence mechanisms, Mrs P filmed around the garden with a running commentary - and although she herself says that it was "not quite up to Attenborough standard" it certainly wasn't far off. Some highlights of these videos include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"You can just imagine a little fox being able to put its paw up in those flowers."</li>
  <li>"We have a vivacious weed here."</li>
  <li>"I'm going to be very wary as I touch this plant." <i>grabs nettle plant</i> "Ouch." <i>continues to hold the plant.</i></li>
  <li>"These are stinging nettles, and I can tell you now, if you had a mouth full of that you wouldn't be back in a hurry for more."</li>
  <li>"Looks harmless enough... <i>until you get up to the stems</i>."</li>
  <li>"Now we're up in the <i><strong>wild </strong></i>part of my garden. Basically up in my weed patch."</li>
  <li>"Now this is a very interesting plant."</li>
  <li>"We just have this lush green growth here."</li>
  <li>"You have the sharp thorns on the leaf here... get that in your mouth and you'll know about it."</li>
</ul>

  <p>"Here's a picture of Mr Porteous standing in a trench. Here's another one of him standing in a trench. Oh! Here's one of him *sitting* in a trench! Here's another one of him standing in a trench."</p>
  <p>"I took a picture of the moss on this trench because it would make a perfect question for my Year 11 students - for example, why does the moss grow on this side not the other?" (Proceeds to explain to me why the moss grew on one side not the other.)</p>

  <p>"I had a bigger sister Rachel who was really really good at chemistry. And we had this chemistry teacher, Mr Worthing he was called, he would pull on my plaits and go "Rachel wouldn't do that" and I'd be going "<strong>I DON'T CARE WHAT RACHEL WOULD HAVE DONE."</strong></p>

  <p>(Repeated every practical we have to use knives) "Did I ever tell you that story about my son Sam cutting an apple? Yes? Oh well some of you wouldn't have been in so I'll say it again." - The gist of the story is she was too lazy to cut an apple for her 5 year old son and got him to do it himself and he cut his hand.</p>
