<p>Mrs Porteous is Head of <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/students/intake15">Year 11</a> and a <a href="/subjects/biology">biology</a> teacher. <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a> is also her husband. One time she let us watch Twilight because it has that one 30 second scene about the science teacher talking about mitosis in the background and so therefore was considered educational.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes</h3>
<p>Mrs P tells an average of 3 stories per lesson. Some of these are recurring, such as each lesson that requires students to use a scalpel she will tell you the story about the time her son was little and went to A &amp; E because he cut his hand whilst cutting an apple because she would rather read magazines than help him. Other stories may only be told because they relate to a certain topic - like when you do the disease topic in <a href="/students/intake16">Year 10</a> and cover measles she tells you about the time she had measles as a kid and the doctor thought she was a boy (to this day she still bears a grudge). Other, rarer stories, only surface when a class strays to somewhere very off topic - such as her hate for her high school <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a> teacher or her mum's recipe for cheese sauce.</p>
<h3>The Next David Attenborough?</h3>
<p>During the lockdown, when we were studying plant defence mechanisms, Mrs P filmed around the garden with a running commentary - and although she herself says that it was "not quite up to Attenborough standard" it certainly wasn't far off. Some highlights of these videos include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"You can just imagine a little fox being able to put its paw up in those flowers."</li>
  <li>"We have a vivacious weed here."</li>
  <li>"I'm going to be very wary as I touch this plant." <i>grabs nettle plant</i> "Ouch." <i>continues to hold the plant.</i></li>
  <li>"These are stinging nettles, and I can tell you now, if you had a mouth full of that you wouldn't be back in a hurry for more."</li>
  <li>"Looks harmless enough... <i>until you get up to the stems</i>."</li>
  <li>"Now we're up in the <i><strong>wild </strong></i>part of my garden. Basically up in my weed patch."</li>
  <li>"Now this is a very interesting plant."</li>
  <li>"We just have this lush green growth here."</li>
  <li>"You have the sharp thorns on the leaf here... get that in your mouth and you'll know about it."</li>
</ul>
<h3>An Avid Seaweed Collector</h3>
<p>Mrs Porteous is no small fan of seaweed, and upon being showed pictures of some she can list the Latin names for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a PowerPoint that was supposed to be about counting daisies she still managed to add in at least 3 slides about seaweed.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>(Slightly taps whiteboard accidentally and it changes slide) "AUGH! That's <strong>not allowed</strong>!"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"And he just died of a heart attack on his porch. What a way to go!"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I think I'm just going to travel everywhere. There'll be nothing left for the kids to inherit at all."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"When I was 17 I had measles for almost a month, and I must have been quite sick because when I went to the doctor he said "oh dear, he isn't looking good with it, is he?" AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT WAS NOT THE RIGHT THING TO SAY TO A 17 YEAR OLD GIRL."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Here's a picture of Mr Porteous standing in a trench. Here's another one of him standing in a trench. Oh! Here's one of him *sitting* in a trench! Here's another one of him standing in a trench."</p>
  <p>"I took a picture of the moss on this trench because it would make a perfect question for my Year 11 students - for example, why does the moss grow on this side not the other?" (Proceeds to explain to me why the moss grew on one side not the other.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We used to draw straws about who would have to go in his car."&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I had a bigger sister Rachel who was really really good at chemistry. And we had this chemistry teacher, Mr Worthing he was called, he would pull on my plaits and go "Rachel wouldn't do that" and I vividly remember "Rachel wouldn't do that" and like "<strong>I DON'T CARE WHAT RACHEL WOULD HAVE DONE." </strong><i>He thought he was funny you know. But at my expense it just wasn't fair."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>(Repeated every practical we have to use knives) "Did I ever tell you that story about my son Sam cutting an apple? Yes? Oh well some of you wouldn't have been in so I'll say it again." - The gist of the story is she was too lazy to cut an apple for her 5 year old son and got him to do it himself and he cut his hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Have I told you this story about...? Yes? Oh well let me tell you again."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
