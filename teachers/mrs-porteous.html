<h2>Mrs Porteous</h2>

<p>Mrs Porteous is Head of <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/students/intake20">Year 7</a> and a <a href="/subjects/biology">biology</a> teacher. <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a> is also her husband. One time she let us watch Twilight because it has that one 30 second scene about the science teacher talking about mitosis in the background and so therefore was considered educational.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes</h3>
<p>Mrs P tells an average of 3 stories per lesson. Some of these are recurring, such as each lesson that requires students to use a scalpel she will tell you the story about the time her son was little and went to A &amp; E because he cut his hand whilst cutting an apple because she would rather read magazines than help him. Other stories may only be told because they relate to a certain topic - like when you do the disease topic in <a href="/students/intake17">Year 10</a> and cover measles she tells you about the time she had measles as a kid and the doctor thought she was a boy (to this day she still bears a grudge). Other, rarer stories, only surface when a class strays to somewhere very off topic - such as her hate for her high school <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a> teacher or her mum's recipe for cheese sauce.</p>
<h3>The Next David Attenborough?</h3>
<p>During the lockdown, when we were studying plant defence mechanisms, Mrs P filmed around the garden with a running commentary - and although she herself says that it was "not quite up to Attenborough standard" it certainly wasn't far off. Some highlights of these videos include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"You can just imagine a little fox being able to put its paw up in those flowers."</li>
  <li>"We have a vivacious weed here."</li>
  <li>"I'm going to be very wary as I touch this plant." <i>grabs nettle plant</i> "Ouch." <i>continues to hold the plant.</i></li>
  <li>"These are stinging nettles, and I can tell you now, if you had a mouth full of that you wouldn't be back in a hurry for more."</li>
  <li>"Looks harmless enough... <i>until you get up to the stems</i>."</li>
  <li>"Now we're up in the <i><strong>wild </strong></i>part of my garden. Basically up in my weed patch."</li>
  <li>"Now this is a very interesting plant."</li>
  <li>"We just have this lush green growth here."</li>
  <li>"You have the sharp thorns on the leaf here... get that in your mouth and you'll know about it."</li>
</ul>
<h3>An Avid Seaweed Collector</h3>
<p>Mrs Porteous is no small fan of seaweed, and upon being showed pictures of some she can list the Latin names for it. Mrs Porteous is a self-acclaimed 'seaweed geek'.</p>
<p>On a PowerPoint that was supposed to be about counting daisies she still managed to add in at least 3 slides about seaweed.</p>

<h3>Rivalry with Rachel &amp; Various Other Sibling Anecdotes</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Rachel always won at Monopoly, and it was so unfair. To this day I am sure she cheated. She would have Park Lane and then do all these dodgy deals with my younger sisters for Mayfair, and whenever <i>I </i>tried it she would tell them that it was a bad deal and they shouldn't listen to me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>“My parents would just stick the four of us in the back of the car on long car journeys, and to make us shut up they would give us boiled sweets. And we'd have a competition about who could make their sweet last the longest but the rules were that you couldn't crunch it you had to suck it. I was always wanting to beat Rachel. She was the eldest, and I was the second eldest so we were very competitive. Anyway, I'd always ended up swallowing mine and Rachel would always win. She won at everything. I'm sure she cheated. She cheated at everything.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I had a bigger sister Rachel who was really really good at chemistry. And we had this chemistry teacher, Mr Worthing he was called, he would pull on my plaits and go "Rachel wouldn't do that" and I vividly remember "Rachel wouldn't do that" and like "<strong>I DON'T CARE WHAT RACHEL WOULD HAVE DONE." </strong><i>He thought he was funny you know. But at my expense it just wasn't fair."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>“</i>Jane's kids all go to posh schools down south. She married a <i>rich </i>husband though. She's the youngest and always got everything she wanted when she was little, so always said she'd need a rich husband to get places. And well, I guess she did.”</p>
