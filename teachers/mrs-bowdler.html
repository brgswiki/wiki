<p>Mrs Bowdler is a <a href="/subjects/mfl">language</a> teacher and Head of <a href="/students/intake16">Year 11</a>. &nbsp;It was devastating and a great loss to many when her snail Shirley Schnecke or Coco the Caracol (Spanish for snail), was thrown into the bin. However her good friend <a href="/teachers/ms-marti">Miss Marti</a> bought her a new Caracol, and it's now okay. She has leather sofas in her office and is often seen walking towards or away from but never in the <a href="/groups/places/clark-building">maths block</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are struggling to find Mrs B in a crowd, perhaps during assembly or a school event then you are looking for the wrong person! Dressed in bright green, orange, yellow or red she stands out a mile from the crowd and seems to be one of the only exceptions to the "wear black and look smart" rule implied by the other staff.</p>
<p>She is a good teacher and nice but do not talk in her lesson - she can come up with some very creative threats.</p>
<p>Mrs Bowdler is also a proud user of the "NO BUMS NO BOOBS NO BELLIES" and this phrase comes into use each week before a non-uniform day. Mrs B is not a fan of the nickname “Rowdy Bowdy” even though ‘Howdy Rowdy Bowdy’ would be a much more upbeat way to start off emails to your head of year.</p>
<h3>It takes two to tango</h3>
<p>Had you attended the Halloween Disco '16, you may remember sitting in your form room simply chatting with your mates, eating wotsits, accumulating glowsticks - simpler times not to last. Before long the Boogie Bowdler made an appearance, enthusiastically trying and failing to get people on the dance floor. Fortunately, we were given a short break only to return back to the hall and find the breakdancing Bowdler dancing with fellow staff as a stormtrooper.</p>
