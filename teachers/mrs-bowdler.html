<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:22.4%;"><img src="/mrs-bowdler.png"><figcaption>Mrs Bowdler trying out some new fashion ideas</figcaption></figure><p>Mrs Bowdler is a language teacher and head of year 10. She has an absolutely exquisite fashion sense. It was devastating and a great loss to many when her snail Shirley Schnecke or Coco the snail, was thrown into the bin. However her good friend <a href="/teachers/ms-marti">Miss Marti</a> bought her a new snail, and it's okay. She has leather sofas in her office and is often seen walking towards or away from but never in the maths block. She lives in Preston and her hair is actually pasta because it keeps changing and taking many unusual shapes and forms. RIP when she had pink hair.</p><p>She is a good teacher and nice but do not talk in her lesson.</p><h2>Quotes</h2><blockquote><p>"ShIrLeY sCnEcKe" *yeets snail at child*</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"ITS DI NOT DIE!!!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Quid kid!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>*gives somebody a pound* "Don't spend it all at once!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Good Morning 8S, I'm <a href="/teachers/mr-fitton">Mr Fitton</a> now!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"There goes Mr Bowdler pretending to be a washing machine... ahh what happens in lockdown..."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"I've never seen the meme pages (30 seconds later) YEAH I KNOW I looked like i was gonna yell at someone in my Teacher of the Week."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"I'm going to throw you out of the window."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(In a very menacing voice after someone was talking over her) "Do you like the way your face is now??!"</p></blockquote>
