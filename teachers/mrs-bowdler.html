<p>Mrs Bowdler is a <a href="/subjects/mfl">language</a> teacher and head of <a href="/students/intake16">year 10</a>. She has an absolutely exquisite fashion sense. It was devastating and a great loss to many when her snail Shirley Schnecke or Coco the snail, was thrown into the bin. However her good friend <a href="/teachers/ms-marti">Miss Marti</a> bought her a new snail, and it's now okay. She has leather sofas in her office and is often seen walking towards or away from but never in the maths block. She lives in Preston and her hair is compared to pasta because it keeps changing and taking many shapes and forms.</p>
<p>She is a good teacher and nice but do not talk in her lesson - she can come up with some very creative threats.</p>
<p>Mrs Bowdler is also a proud user of the "NO BUMS NO BOOBS NO BELLIES" and this phrase comes into use each week before a non-uniform day.</p>
