<h2>Mrs Bowdler</h2>
<p>BOWDLERISATION IS A THING</p>

<p>Mrs Bowdler is a <a href="/subjects/mfl">language</a> teacher and Head of <a href="/students/intake16">Year 11</a>. &nbsp;It was devastating and a great loss to many when her snail Shirley Schnecke or Coco the Caracol (Spanish for snail), was thrown into the bin. However her good friend <a href="/teachers/ms-marti">Miss Marti</a> bought her a new Caracol, and it's now okay. She has leather sofas in her office and is often seen walking towards or away from but never in the <a href="/groups/places/clark-building">maths block</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are struggling to find Mrs B in a crowd, perhaps during assembly or a school event then you are looking for the wrong person! Dressed in bright green, orange, yellow or red she stands out a mile from the crowd and seems to be one of the only exceptions to the "wear black and look smart" rule implied by the other staff.</p>
<p>She is a good teacher and nice but do not talk in her lesson - she can come up with some very creative threats.</p>
<p>Mrs Bowdler is also a proud user of the "NO BUMS NO BOOBS NO BELLIES" and this phrase comes into use each week before a non-uniform day. Mrs B is not a fan of the nickname “Rowdy Bowdy” even though ‘Howdy Rowdy Bowdy’ would be a much more upbeat way to start off emails to your head of year.</p>
<p>Scarily psychic…</p>
<h3>It takes two to tango</h3>
<p>Had you attended the Halloween Disco '16, you may remember sitting in your form room simply chatting with your mates, eating wotsits, accumulating glowsticks - simpler times not to last. Before long the Boogie Bowdler made an appearance, enthusiastically trying and failing to get people on the dance floor. Fortunately, we were given a short break only to return back to the hall and find the breakdancing Bowdler dancing with fellow staff as a stormtrooper.</p>
<h3>The Cheese Sandwiches</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“And then I realised what had happened… I hadn't given <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a> a package full of chocolate cake, but instead… I'd given him my son's cheese sandwiches. I realised this at like half five and I thought ‘I know how to fix this’, but you know when you try to fix something and you make it worse? So anyway I sent him an email saying ‘You might want to check the package I gave you, I might have put my son’s cheese sandwiches in there instead…' but he didn't reply! And so I thought, ‘right I'll send him another email.' and I did, saying the same thing. At this point, I was thinking the worst, as you do whenever someone doesn't reply. Anyway, he did get back to me - apparently, he'd been looking so forward to this chocolate cake that he'd saved it for after tea. Only to open it and find cheese sandwiches. He has a very good sense of humour, hold on look (<i>shows </i>a <i>picture of the cheese sandwiches)</i> there they are – in Mr Porteous' house. But it was all fine because <a href="/teachers/mrs-porteous">Mrs Porteous</a> had also made scones and they'd had those instead - see here are the scones. I feel like he's just going to laugh at me forever behind my back now."</li>
