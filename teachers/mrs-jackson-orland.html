<h2>Mrs Jackson-Orland</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/miss_jackson.png"></figure>
<p>Mrs Jackson-Orland is a <a href="/subjects/spanish">Spanish</a> teacher who normally has orangey red hair (although she would specifically like to point out that this is no longer true).&nbsp;</p>
<p>When she got married, all her classes wanted her husband to take her name because then he would be called Michael Jackson but unfortunately this is not to be.</p>
