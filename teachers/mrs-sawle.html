<h2>Mrs Sawle</h2>
<p>Mrs Sawle is a maths teacher well known for her short - often purple or red - dyed hair. Her classroom is C114.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs Sawle is in fact a very strange lady and has whenever she comes up in conversation with other people everyone seems to have a different story about her - including the fact she has a donkey, bow and arrow, bouncy castle, and one teacher even swears she said she had a lift.</p>
<p>She will also use an iPad to choose her victims and sadly Siri can't pronounce any names, so we are all left confused.</p>
<p>After explaining things she says 'Yes?' but no one is really sure if it is a question or not and therefore everyone just nods a little bit in a very scared manner. Her maths lessons also often make use of the Pirate Game.</p>
<p>If you are on a school trip and Mrs Sawle is your group leader, be prepared! You will get woken up at 6:45 sharp by what sounds like someone trying to smash the door down.</p>
<p>She once sent a team out for getting 10 out of 10 on some rounds on the maths Christmas quiz because she thought they were cheating.</p>
<h3>Year 7 maths set of 2018/19</h3>
<p>One certain Year 7 (now <a href="/students/intake18">Year 9</a>) maths class who had Mrs Sawle had a Whatsapp group chat (with most of the class in it) and one bright spark decided to change the name and icon to Mrs Sawle, of course they all thought nothing of it...</p>
<p>A little while later in a maths lesson with Mrs Sawle one poor soul had to go to the bathroom and was told to leave their phone on the desk. Whilst they were gone, Mrs Sawle saw that notifications were coming in from 'Mrs Sawle'! Puzzled, she jokingly said 'Ahaha why am I sending messages to this person's phone?', and not soon later the whole story was uncovered and the Whatsapp group was torn apart, everyone who was saved as a contact in the person's phone was given a penalty point or two, and Mrs Sawle has never looked at the maths set the same since...</p>
