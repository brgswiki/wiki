<h2>Mr Jackson</h2>
<p>Mr Jackson is a business studies and economics teacher (he is elusive and little known to lower year students).&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has been described by other teachers as 'the one who never follows the implied staff dress code and doesn't wear smart trousers'.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/teachers/past/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a>, Mr Jackson loves listening to students singing, polishes Mr Reeves' shoes, and being on his level is the lowest you can stoop.</p>
<h3>His Game with Mr Chadwick</h3>
<p><a href="/teachers/past/mr-chadwick">Mr Chadwick</a> was immersed in a game with Mr Jackson whereby each made up stories about the other and reported them to their class as fact. This led to such classics as Mr Jackson's Thai Bride, and the instance where Mr Chadwick's class had to ask him whether he <i>really</i> was the Mayor of Ramsbottom. Others stories included that MC chadwich was a part time acid house DJ and the time the upper sixth bought him a present on what they thought was his birthday, but it was bogus as Mr Jackson had made it up.</p>
<p>Mr Chadwick and Mr. Jackson never seemed to speak with any other teachers; rumour has it they were plotting to take over the school.</p>
