<h2>Miss Powell</h2>
<p>Miss Powell is Head of the Maths Department and a hardcore Everton fan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people who haven't had her as a maths teacher will probably know her from the Leaver's Day Tik Toks. On her Year 11's last maths lesson she framed her favourite maths memes and gave them out as prizes.</p>
<p>She also loves Groot…</p>
