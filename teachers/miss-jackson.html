<p>Miss Jackson is a <a href="/subjects/spanish">Spanish</a> teacher who normally has orangey red hair (although she would specifically like to point out that this is no longer true).&nbsp;</p>
<p>When she got married, all her classes wanted her husband to take her name because then he would be called Michael Jackson but unfortunately this is not to be.</p>
