<h2>Mrs Bamford</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/mrs_bamford.png"></figure>
<p>Mrs Bamford is Head of the <a href="/subjects/art">Art</a> Department, and consequently has the "best room" possibly in the whole of school. Although she is known by many lower school students for being a strict art teacher, she is actually decent (as long as you do the work of course). A lot of the time she isn't actually in because she is 'grading GCSE/A-Level artwork' or is sick. She likes a band called 'Let's Eat Grandma' and spent a lesson showing us their songs.</p>
<h3>The Bat Cave</h3>
<p>Like all the art teachers, if you cannot find her, she is probably in the art teacher hideout (the room between A01 and A02). This room is rumoured to be the Tardis as there is no way more than one person let alone 3 people can fit here alongside a coffee machine, art supplies, many many books and god knows what else.</p>
<h3>A Guide to Getting Deepening+ With Mrs Bamford</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add a background to your work - this can be achieved through a number of methods, although preferably tea staining</li>
  <li>You can never add enough photos</li>
  <li>Don't bother writing in pen, just type out any info and print it out</li>
  <li>Do <i>not</i> use black in your work! In her words she considers black to be 'like a black hole in the middle of your work', instead just mix some colours until you get a murky brown.</li>
</ul>
