<h3>Lessons</h3>
<p>For each topic she has a few favourite words and these are mentioned every 30 seconds until if you see or hear the word again in common conversation you just want to move country, learn 7 new languages and never come into contact with the English language again. Some of these words/phrases include “patriotic“, “patriarchal society”, “objectification“, “fate”. Saying this, this is actually a good teaching tactic and is works very well for "Birds’ Eye View"</p>
