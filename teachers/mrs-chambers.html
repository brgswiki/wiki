<h2>Mrs Chambers</h2>
<p>Mrs Chambers is a new <a href="/subjects/geography">geography</a> teacher as of &nbsp;last year. She is obsessed with talking about Cowpe and that she dearly loves her innovative towel glove, used for wiping the whiteboards clean…</p>
<p>The start of Google Meets are often taken up by listening to music whilst waiting for the rest of the class to join. Her taste in music is impeccable.</p>
<p>Considered a legend by many of her students, despite her reputation as a strict marker. Was flattered to hear her outfits resembled a Temple Run character. Also loves the frogs in her garden, and can draw incredibly perfect circles</p>
