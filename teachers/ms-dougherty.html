<h2>Ms Dougherty</h2>
<p>Ms Dougherty is an <a href="/subjects/english">English</a> teacher and also a member of SLT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She organises all the timetables for each student and sometimes does assemblies (getting very passionate about the colours of bins).</p>
<p>Whenever she walks into a lesson she seems to always have a can of cherry cola(?).</p>
<h3>Health and Safety Gone Mad</h3>
<p>Ms Dougherty is the physical embodiment of ‘health and safety gone mad’ - only short of wrapping the school desk corners in excessive layers of bubble wrap and banning pencil sharpeners so students can't weaponise their pencils. Ironically however, the greatest threat in school is the speeds she reaches whilst making her way through the corridors even whilst on heels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would have a glittering career as a risk analyst.&nbsp;</p>
