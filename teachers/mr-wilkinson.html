<p>Mr Wilkinson is Head of the Physics Department and is well known throughout school for being chill.</p>
<p>Like a few of the other <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> teachers, he has proven himself to be an absolute memester and puts memes on the back of worksheets to get students to stick them in, and when <a href="/teachers/mrs-stevenson-jones">Mrs Stevenson-Jones</a> was off school ill he sent her a bunch of memes from the school <a href="/other/meme-pages">meme pages</a> which in her words 'made her day'. His favourite meme page is also BRGSMemes123 &lt;3</p>
<h3>Staffroom Shenanigans&nbsp;</h3>
<p>When Mr Brandwood forgot his tie, Wilko decided he should step up and help poor <a href="/teachers/mr-brandwood">Mr Brandwood</a> solve his uniform issue. He did this by cutting out the shape of a tie from a plastic bag and leaving it on Mr Brandwood's desk with a note saying 'I got your back, bro'. Now, this would have been all fine but as Mr Brandwood was wearing it whilst teaching, <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a> walked in to talk to him about the fecal matter on the floor of room 88 and upon seeing the state of his 'tie' he just went "I'll come back later" leaving a very panicked Mr B. When Mr Brandwood told Mr Wilkinson about the incident later, Wilko allegedly just laughed.</p>
