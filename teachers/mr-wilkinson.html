<h2>Mr Wilkinson</h2>
<p>Mr Wilkinson is Head of the Physics Department and is well known throughout school for his relaxed behaviour.</p>
<p>Like a few of the other <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> teachers, he has proven himself to be an absolute memester and puts memes on the back of worksheets to get students to stick them in, and when <a href="/teachers/mrs-stevenson-jones">Mrs Stevenson-Jones</a> was off school ill he sent her a bunch of memes from the school meme pages which in her words 'made her day'. His favourite meme page is also BRGSMemes123 &lt;3</p>
<h3>Staffroom Shenanigans&nbsp;</h3>
<p>When Mr Brandwood forgot his tie, Wilko decided he should step up and help poor Mr Brandwood solve his uniform issue. He did this by cutting out the shape of a tie from a plastic bag and leaving it on Mr Brandwood's desk with a note saying 'I got your back, bro'. Now, this would have been all fine but as Mr Brandwood was wearing it whilst teaching, <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a> walked in to talk to him about something and upon seeing the state of his 'tie' he just went "I'll come back later" leaving a very panicked Mr B. When Mr Brandwood told Mr Wilkinson about the incident later, Wilko allegedly just laughed.</p>
