<h2>Mrs Spall</h2>
<p>Mrs Spall is a piano and woodwind teacher who normally teaches in PR 2 (pre and post covid). She has lessons on Monday afternoons, Wednesday (all days) and Thursday afternoons. Like <a href="/teachers/music/mr-brown">Mr Brown</a>, she is super nice and positive, but gets a little annoyed if you don't practiceâ€¦</p>
