<h2>Mrs Spall</h2>
<p>Mrs Spall is a piano and woodwind teacher who normally teaches in PR 3 (PR2 covid). She has lessons on Monday afternoons, Wednesday (all days) and Thursday afternoons. Although her laugh might get on your nerves a little, she is super nice and positive, but gets a little annoyed if you don't practice…</p>
