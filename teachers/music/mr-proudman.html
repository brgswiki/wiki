  <li>He says hello and you take about 5 minutes taking your instrument out and asking how each other's week has been</li>
  <li>You spend a good 20 minutes showing him all the pieces you've been practising.</li>
  <li>The remainder of your allotted time is spent practicing a certain part of a piece, or start a new one</li>
  <li>He then realises he hasn't heard you play the full piece yet, and makes the next person wait so he can listen to your piece</li>
