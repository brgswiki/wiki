<h2>Mr Brown</h2>
<p>Mr Brown is a private lesson music teacher who teaches Brass and Theory lessons and left at the end of the 2020/21 school year, to be a lecturer at Manchester University. Normally, he would teach on Wednesday afternoons and Friday all day. He is one of the nicest music teachers, he is constantly positive and has a bunch of really helpful exercises to help with brass (including the elephant book?!). He often taught in PR 5, but Post - Covid he taught in Room 51 (as people can't keep their masks on while playing brass).</p>
<h3>A typical lesson with Mr Brown</h3>
<ul>
  <li>He says hello and you take about 3 minutes taking you're instrument out and asking how each other's day has been</li>
  <li>You spend a good 10 minutes doing warm ups and exercises</li>
  <li>The remainder of you're allotted time is spent practicing a certain part of a piece</li>
  <li>He then realises he hasn't hard you play the full piece yet, and makes the next person wait so he can listen to your piece</li>
</ul>
