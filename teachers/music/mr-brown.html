<h2>Mr Brown</h2>
<p>Mr Brown is a private lesson music teacher who teaches Brass and Theory lessons and teaches on Wednesday afternoons and Friday all day. He is one of the nicest music teachers, he is constantly positive and has a bunch of really helpful exercises to help with brass (including the elephant book?!).</p>
