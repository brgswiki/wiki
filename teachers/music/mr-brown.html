<h2>Mr Brown</h2>
<p>Mr Brown is a private lesson music teacher who teaches Brass and Theory lessons and teaches on Wednesday afternoons and Friday all day. He is one of the nicest music teachers, he is constantly positive and has a bunch of really helpful exercises to help with brass (including the elephant book?!). He often teaches in PR 5, but Post - Covid he teaches in Room 51 (as people can't keep their masks on while playing brass).</p>
