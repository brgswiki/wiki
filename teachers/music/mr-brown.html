<h2>Mr Brown</h2>
<p>Mr Brown is a private lesson music teacher who teaches Brass and Theory lessons and teaches on Wednesday afternoons and Friday all day. He is one of the nicest music teachers, he is constantly positive and has a bunch of really helpful exercises to help with brass (including the elephant book?!). He often teaches in PR 5, but Post - Covid he teaches in Room 51 (as people can't keep their masks on while playing brass).</p>
<h3>A typical lesson with Mr Brown</h3>
<ul>
  <li>He says hello and you take about 3 minutes taking you're instrument out and asking how each other's day has been</li>
  <li>You spend a good 10 minutes doing warm ups and exercises</li>
  <li>The remainder of you're allotted time is spent practicing a certain part of a piece</li>
  <li>He then realises he hasn't hard you play the full piece yet, and makes the next person wait so he can listen to you're piece</li>
</ul>
