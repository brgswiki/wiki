<h2>Mrs Blyfield</h2>
<p>Mrs Blyfield is the ‘Music Admin’ (or so is her name on google classroom), which basically means she makes all the music timetables, sorts the music trips out, organises practice rooms and manages the google classrooms. She is one of the nicest members of staff in school, and she's great to have a laugh with. If you're ever bored at lunch, just pop into her office and say hello (pre-covid of course) and you can have a great trip about <a href="/groups/trips/london-music-trip">London 2020</a>, the timetables or her coffee machine.</p>
