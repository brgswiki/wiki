<h2>Miss Flint</h2>
<p>Miss Flint is an <a href="/subjects/art">art</a> teacher at BRGS and like all the art teachers is often found in the hidden room between A01 and A02.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She is obsessed with silence and can often be heard saying 'the next person to speak is getting a penalty point!' often to no avail. Miss Flint also makes her lower year students wait outside the Art Block before lesson unless it is raining. One time her Year 8 class waited outside in the snow for something like 10 minutes because she never specified you could go inside if it was snowing not just raining, leading to some very cold Year 8s.</p>
<p>She was on maternity leave at the end of 2017 and the infamous <a href="/teachers/past/ms-rogers">Mrs Rogers</a> covered for her.</p>
