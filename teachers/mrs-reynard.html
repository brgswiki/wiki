<h2>Mrs Reynard</h2>
<p>Mrs Reynard is a law and textiles teacher. She is very nice and is easily swayed from the subject she is teaching. One textiles lesson she spent almost the whole hour telling us about the wooden beams in her house, and how they were Grade 2 listed, and how a postman or something once was like 'woah those are some lovely wooden beams'. Some say Mrs Reynard is rumoured to secretly be that angry old lady from Madagascar's sister.</p>
