<p>Mrs H was previously <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a>' PA and now works for Mr Johnstone. What this prestigious job entails of we shall never know, however Mrs Hughes likely knows and does more about the day to day running of the school than all of SLT combined (excluding <a href="/teachers/past/mr-reeves">Mr Reeves</a> of course). Mrs H also goes on a number of school trips and has taken part in fundraisers, including the abseil down the front of BRGS.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run the school whilst Mr P is designing/measuring/building/decorating extensions - generally about 5 out of 6 half terms</li>
