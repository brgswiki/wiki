<h2>Mrs Kirk</h2>
<p>Mrs Kirk is the school librarian, and is the organiser of a number of (book themed) events such as quizzes, treasure hunts, or the famous shelfie competition and is perhaps more active than some <a href="/other/head-of-year">head of years</a> when it comes to Google Classroom updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs Kirk is not a fan of Enid Blyton.</p>
