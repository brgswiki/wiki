<h2>Mrs Baines</h2>
<p>Mrs Baines is BRGS's resident school nurse, when she is not in her <a href="/groups/rooms/other/15">office</a>, Mrs B is probably on a school trip. Aside from the usual dealing paracetamol, ice-packs, and wet paper towels, Mrs Baines knows all and can often be spotted walking on a mission to aid an ill student before they themselves even know they're under the weather.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Student: Miss, do you want a wafer? They're vanilla flavoured. (A lie they were actually unfortunately cheese flavoured)</p>
  <p>Mrs B: Ah these remind me of my childhood.</p>
  <p>Student: â€¦They're cheese flavoured?</p>
