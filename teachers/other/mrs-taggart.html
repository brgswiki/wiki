<h2>Mrs Taggart</h2>
<p>Mrs Taggart is the school's business manager, meaning she deals with anything finance-y and to do with corridors. She resides in the business offices near the bottom entrance of school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs Taggart also goes on a few trips - including <a href="/groups/trips/china">China</a> - where she can deal out expert advice to whichever falling out she has to deal with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her attempts at ‘the woah’ and dabbing are flawless.</p>
