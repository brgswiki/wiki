<h2>Ms Curry</h2>
<p>Ms Curry is a maths teacher who joined at the start of the 2019/20 school year.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Jive Master</h3>
<p>Ms Curry is in fact very skilled at jiving and it is said instead of walking she just jives her way around town. On the last lesson before Christmas she taught some of her maths classes some jive moves, who in turn tried to teach <a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">Mr Porteous</a> how to jive. After one attempt he believed he was 'better at dad-dancing' and promptly left (although as he walked away a couple of people could have sworn they saw him trying to practise the jive step we'd just tried to show him).</p>

  <p>“Fractions are our friends!”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My apologies” (whenever she makes a mistake, like saying 1+1=7)</p>
