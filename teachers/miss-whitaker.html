<h2>Miss Whitaker</h2>
<p>Miss Whitaker is a maths teacher from Newcastle, she enjoys soup, gravy and velociraptors, and can do a flawless impression of one. She likes giving a rainforest's worth of Corbett Maths/Dr Frost booklets as homework. She dislikes spelling, missing out questions in booklets and people who have never watched Frozen (her favourite movie).</p>
<p>She is often seen in and around the <a href="/groups/places/clark-building">maths block</a> and always wears high heels, so you can hear her coming down the corridor from miles away, giving everyone time to put away their phones and sit down (not that many people do). Also, she appears to have superhuman skills that allow her to instantly clear a pathway between students, especially down the stairs in the Maths block, and even at the busiest times in the school day, so stay right behind her if you're in a rush. She often says "yous" instead of "you" and always asks if anyone needs help every 30 seconds (no one ever does).</p>

  <p>“Oh my god I'm telling you these are the crisps of 2020 let me show you.” (looks up Hula Hoop Flavarings on the board) “See they're just perfect though, cos like they have a different texture to Hula Hoops like they're not as hard, and they're bigger too so you can actually fit them on your fingers, and the spicy flavour is just amazin, like they're not too spicy and you don't need a spicy dip to actually make them spicy.”</p>
