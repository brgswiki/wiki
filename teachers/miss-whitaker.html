<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:15.94%;"><img src="/miss-whitaker.png"><figcaption>Miss Whitaker thinking about soup</figcaption></figure><p>Miss Whitaker is a maths teacher from Newcastle, she enjoys soup, gravy and velociraptors. If you see her velociraptor impression then you are lucky. She likes giving a rainforest's worth of MyMaths booklets as homework and then not checking them. She currently has braces, which she does not enjoy and gives her a slight lisp. Her accent is something and has been compared to a miner's which she did not appreciate. She dislikes spelling, missing out questions in booklets and people who have never watched Frozen (her favourite movie).</p><p>She is often seen in and around the maths block and always wears high heels, so you can hear her coming down the corridor from miles away, giving everyone time to put away their phones and sit down (not that many people do). Also, she appears to have superhuman skills that allow her to instantly clear a pathway between students, especially down the stairs in the Maths block, and even at the busiest times in the school day, so stay right behind her if you're in a rush. She often says "yous" instead of "you" and always asks if anyone needs help every 30 seconds.</p><h3>Quotes</h3><blockquote><p>"Oh I don't know what's on your book, pass it here." (smells it) "Ooohh I think it's soup."</p><p>Some kid: Wait miss, what's on my book?</p><p>"Ahh that'll be nail polish or gravy."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Why didn't yous send me an email?

Yous lot are well boring."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Alright guys here's the textbook." (Every 30 seconds from then) "Do any of yous need help with anything?" (No one ever puts their hand up)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"OH MY GOD. Yous have never watched FROZEN??? That's my <strong>FAVOURITE</strong> movie."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(Upon spelling) "How do you spell 'falafel'?"</p><p>"Is 'Asian' spelt like 'Asain'?"</p><p>"How do you spell 'reindeer'?"</p></blockquote>
