<h2>Mrs Harper</h2>
<p>Mrs Harper is a very tall English teacher, with a very distinct English teacher fashion sense. If you don’t speak much in her lessons, be warned, she will choose you for pretty much every question until you start putting up your hand yourself and then she ignores you. The best way to avoid this is answer as many easy questions at the start of the lesson in September and then you’re practically safe.</p>

<h3>Lessons</h3>
<p>For each topic she has a few favourite words and these are mentioned every 30 seconds until if you see or hear the word again in common conversation you just want to move country, learn 7 new languages and never come into contact with the English language again. Some of these words/phrases include “patriotic“, “patriarchal society”, “objectification“, “fate”.</p>
