<h2>New to Editing?</h2>
<p>What can I do to help? How do I format pages? What needs doing? (etc etc)</p>
<p>Well, you've come to the right place! Here is a quick and handy guide for anyone wishing to edit.</p>
<h3>What can I do to help?</h3>
<p>A wiki is essentially a website that anyone with a registered account can edit. By clicking on the edit tab at the top of any page, you can edit its contents. You can get an account by clicking on the top right of the page.</p>
<h4><strong>Edit and Add-to</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Already existing articles may need lots of work or tweaks here and there, or just simply expanding.</li>
  <li>Text editing is easy to do, just add whatever you like, as long as it's clean.</li>
  <li>We can correct any mistakes so don't worry about 'destroying' anything!</li>
  <li>If you want any help editing, look at <a href="https://old.brgswiki.org/wiki/HowToEdit">the editing help &amp; guidelines</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Make 'Stubs'</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Click on red links or search for a page name that doesn't exist to start editing a new page. Making very short articles stimulates people to edit the text, which helps grow the content of the website.</li>
  <li>These pages don't need to be long, just created to encourage others to edit!</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Format Content</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>If you're familiar with the codes to make an article look nice then by all means go ahead and make it look pretty.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Learn how to use the Wiki:</h2>
<h3>Creating a new page</h3>
<ol>
  <li>If you haven't already, create a user account - this should be verified by a wiki moderator quickly but do give us a nag if we're not on the dot fast enough!</li>
  <li>Once you have created an account and it has been verified, you will see some extra buttons at the top right of the page when you log on. Click this one: (this is for creating a page from scratch, if you are creating from clicking on a red link skip to step 5)</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:28.22%;"><img src="/editing1.png"></figure>
<p>3. This will bring up a pop-up that looks like this:&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:73.88%;"><img src="/editing2.png"></figure>
<p>4. Click whichever folder on the left hand side fits your page most, for example, if your page is a teacher, then click teacher. If your page is a classroom, click rooms (this will then also allow you to go more specific and choose subject classrooms for example). Once you have done this, type in the name of your page at the bottom (no caps needed and this makes it easier to find the page in the future).</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:73.58%;"><img src="/editing3.png"></figure>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:72.83%;"><img src="/editing4.png"></figure>
<p>5. Once you have pressed select, you will be taken to your new page - however there will be a few details you will need to fill out first. Another pop-up will appear that looks like this, select Visual Editor as this is the easiest to edit, similar to a word document etc.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:59.93%;"><img src="/editing5.png"></figure>
<p>6. Then fill out the blank gaps on the next pop-up with the correct details and press ok, for example:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:67.18%;"><img src="/editing6.png"></figure>
<p>7. Fill in the page like a word document with whatever content you wish and press ‘create’ to save it! You can then start adding links to it from other pages if you want other people to find it.</p>
