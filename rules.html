<h2>Wiki Rules</h2>
<p>Here are our wiki rules, please try to stick to them otherwise your content will just be deleted or you could be suspended for a short while. A lot of our rules are just common sense but are written down for technicality's sake - our rules are very similar to the <a href="https://old.brgswiki.org/wiki/Help:Editorial_guidelines">old Wiki's rules.</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>All articles must be in no way offensive to an individual, or group of individuals</strong>. Keep it polite and light hearted, and know where to draw the line. Anyone posting derogatory, offensive or blatantly insulting comments will be banned for one day, as a fair warning. If you continue to do so the banning period will just be extended. A general rule of thumb - if you would not want to see it on your page, don't put it on somebody else's! Please note, bullying will <strong>not</strong> be tolerated and we can easily contact the school if necessary.</li>
  <li><strong>Respect the privacy of others.</strong> Just like we protect your privacy (<a href="/privacy">we even wrote a fancy policy, go read!</a>), we expect you to do the same when writing pages or comments. Please don't use the names of other students or your own if writing in teacher quote boxes, and make sure your account name isn't personally identifiable. <mark class="pen-red">Please note that if a teacher related story </mark><i><mark class="pen-red"><u>didn't</u></mark></i><mark class="pen-red"> happen in school or on a school trip, or hasn't told you the story in class etc, please do&nbsp;<strong> <u>not</u></strong> post it on the wiki.</mark> This includes things such as previous schools etc. Any content of this nature will be considered a breach of privacy and will be removed. Depending on what has posted, you may be banned for a certain length of time or even permanently.</li>
  <li><strong>Respect what the wiki is for. </strong>This website was created by a small group of people with the intention of preserving our memories of BRGS, the friends we made there, the teachers we got to know, the field trips we went on and so forth. It is now open for all students and alumni - especially now as some students may not have got the Leavers' Do they had in mind because of covid-19. This site is for facts, memories, events, quotes, anything pleasant and polite as a record of your schooldays. IT IS NOT FOR INSULTS, OPINIONS OR PERSONAL VENDETTAS.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Spelling and grammar should be checked before posting</strong> - it looks much more professional that way. Please take the time to write out your edits and comments in full English - that is, not shortening words or abbreviations. Pages which consist entirely of this nonsense are deleted immediately, so you're just wasting your time!</li>
  <li><strong>You must not use images from copyrighted sources</strong>. Furthermore, please don't use any images that are offensive or would make a person look bad/tarnish their reputation without their permission.</li>
  <li><strong>Ensure all pictures must be suitable for a wide audience</strong> - Year 7s and possibly even Year 6s who'd want to start BRGS in Year 7 would be viewing these and therefore they must be appropriate.</li>
  <li><strong>If a quote involves a swear-word, use asterisks!</strong> Try not to swear unless when it is part of someone's quote or it feels necessary to put emphasis on something etc. Anyone using slurs or swearing for no particular reason on a page will be immediately banned.</li>
  <li><strong>When deleting large chunks of pages please state why</strong>. We want as much content as we can get on the wiki, so when deleting content please state a good reason. Do not delete a page without consulting us first, as it will just be restored if no reason is given.</li>
  <li><strong>No vandalism.</strong> This includes deleting pages, spam, creating useless pages, adding lots of unnecessary or inappropriate content. Any of these will result in a temporary or permanent ban depending on how often or how serious the vandalism is.</li>
  <li><strong>Read the </strong><a href="/editing"><strong>editing guidelines</strong></a><strong>. </strong>They are an easy reference to learn how to edit the wiki, please take a read before you get started to ensure the quality of our content remains as high as possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not harass the moderators. </strong>Our moderators and admins are all volunteers and give up their free time to help maintain the site. Time we could spend being '<i>studious and diligent pupils'</i> is now spent helping you set up your page - please take that into account if we do not respond to a request right away! Do not badger or verbally abuse us - we will get round to your request as soon as possible - we do have lives!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Offences</h3>
<p>Editing the wiki may seem a daunting prospect - especially with all our rules in place! But don't worry, you won't be reprimanded for anything accidental that you may not have realised was breaking our rules or just messing up a page because we understand that this is an accident. We do not want to scare away any prospective editors!&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there are some things that often are in no way accidental:</p>
<h4>Minor offences</h4>
<p>This includes blanking pages without good reason, swearing in a page where it isn't necessary, minor privacy breaches as you may not have realised it was so, 'small' attacks or offensive comments (ie. so and so has a horrible fashion sense, yadda yadda is stupid) - even if you are friends with someone and it is something like an inside joke and add comments like this, we cannot determine who is behind username and therefore you may be warned for this.</p>
<p>Minor offences will not immediately result in a ban as we understand that people would have a reason for some of these things or forgotten the rules, or we may be unaware of the context behind it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If after a warning the user continues to carry out the same offence a two day ban will be put in place, then four days, then a week, then two weeks, and then they will be banned permanently.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Major offences</h4>
<p>This includes anything racist, homophobic, xenophobic, misogynistic or along those lines, images or comments of a sexual nature, offensive comments attacking a person, breaching somebody's privacy by sharing things such as addresses, phone numbers, and other means of contacting them such as social media usernames - this goes double for staff members.</p>
<p>Since a lot of these things are unlikely accidental, the user will be given a warning and banned for a week, and then if they continue, two weeks, and then permanently.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us by email at <a href="mailto:support@brgswiki.tk?subject=BRGS%20Wiki%20Support%3A%20%5Byour%20query%20here%5D&amp;body=Hi%20there%2C%0D%0A%0D%0A">support@brgswiki.tk</a></p>
<p>Also if anything goes wrong and you <i>somehow </i>manage to break part of the site, just send us an email (above) and we can restore from a backup (we take backups every 5 minutes). This applies to vandals too, there's no point! We will just ban your account and set the page back to its original state.</p>
<p>Our main function is just to be an up-to-date version of the old wiki, with yearbook &amp; BRGS Website type functions, and therefore our rules are in place to try and create that as much as possible.</p>
<h4><i>Thank you for sticking to our guidelines and enjoy! </i>üôåüêø</h4>
