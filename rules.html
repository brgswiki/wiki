<p>Here are our wiki rules, please try to stick to them otherwise your content will just be deleted or you could be suspended for a short while. Our rules are very similar to the <a href="https://old.brgswiki.org/wiki/Help:Editorial_guidelines">old Wiki's rules.</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>All articles must be in no way offensive to an individual, or group of individuals</strong>. Keep it polite and light hearted, and know where to draw the line. Anyone posting derogatory, offensive or blatantly insulting comments will be banned for one day, as a fair warning. If you continue to do so the banning period will just be extended.</li>
  <li><strong>Respect the privacy of others.</strong> Just like we protect your privacy (<a href="/privacy">we even wrote a fancy policy, go read!</a>), we expect you to do the same when writing pages. Please don't use the names of other students or your own, and make sure your account name isn't personally identifiable. Similarly, the general rule for content to protect people's private lives is that if it <i>didn't</i> happen in school or on a school trip, please <i><u>do not</u> </i>post it on the wiki, unless you have explicit permission to do so.</li>
  <li><strong>Spelling and grammar should be checked before posting</strong> - it looks much more professional that way. Please take the time to write out your comments in full English - that is, not shortening words or abbreviations. Pages which consist entirely of this nonsense are deleted immediately, so you're just wasting your time!</li>
  <li><strong>You must not use images from copyrighted sources</strong>. Furthermore, please don't use any images that are offensive or would make a person look bad/tarnish their reputation without their permission.</li>
  <li><strong>Ensure all pictures must be suitable for a wide audience</strong> - Year 7s and possibly even Year 6s who'd want to start BRGS in Year 7 would be viewing these and therefore they must be appropriate.</li>
  <li><strong>If a quote involves a swear-word, use asterisks!</strong> Try not to swear unless when it is part of someone's quote or it feels necessary to put emphasis on something etc.</li>
  <li><strong>When deleting large chunks of pages please state why</strong>. We want as much content as we can get on the wiki, so when deleting content please state a good reason.</li>
  <li><strong>No vandalism.</strong> This includes deleting pages, spam, creating useless pages, adding lots of unnecessary or inappropriate content. Any of these will result in a temporary or permanent ban depending on how often or how serious the vandalism is.</li>
  <li><strong>Read the </strong><a href="/editing"><strong>editing guidelines</strong></a><strong>. </strong>They are an easy reference to learn how to edit the wiki, please take a read before you get started to ensure the quality of our content remains as high as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact us by email at <a href="mailto:support@brgswiki.tk?subject=BRGS%20Wiki%20Support%3A%20%5Byour%20query%20here%5D&amp;body=Hi%20there%2C%0D%0A%0D%0A">support@brgswiki.tk</a></p>
<p>Also if anything goes wrong and you <i>somehow </i>manage to break part of the site, just send us an email (above) and we can restore from a backup (we take backups every 5 minutes).</p>
<p>Our main function is just to be an up-to-date version of the old wiki and therefore our rules are in place to try and create that as much as possible.</p>
<h4><i>Thank you for sticking to our guidelines and enjoy! </i>üôåüêø</h4>
