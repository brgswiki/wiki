<p>Physics is probably one of the easiest subjects at BRGS, not because of the content but because the whole department are among the nicest teachers in school. Even if you are no physicsy person you can't help but find BRGS physics lessons fun. The content often involves a lot of measuring how long it takes hot water to cool down or using the Van De Graff generator, then watching a very complex and mathsy video that no one really understands but this never comes up in tests or exams. The physics department also have a Twitter page which can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/BRGS_Physics">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
