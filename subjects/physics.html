<h2>Physics</h2>
<p>Physics is probably one of the easiest subjects at BRGS, not because of the content but because the whole department are among the nicest teachers in school. Even if you are no physicsy person you can't help but find BRGS physics lessons fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Physics mostly involves answering questions that revolve around borderline animal abuse or words that one may think should be interchangeable but apparently aren't, but then again in adulthood when won't we need to know the momentum at which two trolleys may hit each other and the energy transferred etc (assuming there is no air resistance of course).</p>
<p>The content often involves a lot of boiling water in different conditions - perhaps to train us how to make a good cup of tea on a Bunsen burner when we reach adulthood.</p>
<p>The physics department also have a Twitter page which can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/BRGS_Physics">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
