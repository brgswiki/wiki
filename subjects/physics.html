<h2>Physics</h2>
<p>Physics is probably one of the easiest subjects at BRGS, not because of the content but because the whole department are among the nicest teachers in school. Even if you are no physicsy person you can't help but find BRGS physics lessons fun. The physics department have a similar vibe to the original Horrible Histories cast.</p>
<p>Physics mostly involves answering questions that revolve around borderline animal abuse or words that one may think should be interchangeable but apparently aren't, but then again in adulthood when won't we need to know the momentum at which two trolleys may hit each other and the energy transferred etc (assuming there is no air resistance of course).</p>
<p>The content often involves a lot of boiling water in different conditions - perhaps to train us how to make a good cup of tea on a Bunsen burner when we reach adulthood.</p>
<p>It seems to be that the physics department are also the most in touch with the memes, therefore some students (and staff!) think that they actually run the meme pages.</p>
<p>They absolutely need to make their own cover of the 21 GCSE Physics Equation song.</p>
<p>The physics department also have a Twitter page which can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/BRGS_Physics">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
