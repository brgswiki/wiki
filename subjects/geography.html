<p>Geography is one of the semi-optional humanity subjects. It used to be equal with history in terms of video hours, but as the course became more content heavy most lessons now revolve around writing set paragraphs.</p>
<p>The best bit of Geography is the high-tech method of measuring the velocity of a river - two poles to mark a section of river of known length, and a watch to time how long it takes for the <i>Bonio Dog Biscuit</i> to travel between the two poles. If you look in the geography storage room (next to Room 94) you can find a large stock of dog biscuits. These only seem to come out on Open Evening, where the geography corridor becomes transformed into something like a supermarket pet food aisle and prospective students are shown a bunch of tape measures and get to place a sticker of where they live on a map.</p>
<p>Most of years 7, 8 and possibly 9, simply consists of title pages and photo-copied worksheets. Once you get to GCSE and A-Level it is basically the same but you get to write a paragraph or two each lesson along with the rainforest worth of colouring sheets.</p>
