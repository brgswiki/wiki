<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Geography is one of the semi-optional humanity subjects. It used to be equal with <a href="/subjects/history">history</a> in terms of video hours, but as the course became more content heavy most lessons now revolve around writing set paragraphs.</p>
<p>The best bit of Geography is the high-tech method of measuring the velocity of a river - two poles to mark a section of river of known length, and a watch to time how long it takes for the <i>Bonio Dog Biscuit</i> to travel between the two poles. If you look in the geography storage room (next to <a href="/groups/rooms/drama/94">Room 94</a>) you can find a large stock of dog biscuits. These only seem to come out on <a href="/groups/events/open-evening">Open Evening</a>, where the geography corridor becomes transformed into something like a supermarket pet food aisle and prospective students are shown a bunch of tape measures and get to place a sticker of where they live on a map.</p>
<p>Most of years 7, 8 and possibly 9, simply consists of title pages and photo-copied worksheets. Once you get to GCSE and A-Level it is basically the same but you get to write a paragraph or two each lesson along with the rainforest worth of colouring sheets.</p>
