<h2>PE</h2>
<p>This subject takes place in a range of <a href="/map">locations</a>, often the <a href="/groups/places/astroturf">astroturf</a> in winter and the indoor sports hall in summer for no particular reason.</p>
<h3>Typical Lessons</h3>
<p>If you are a girl, your lessons will consist of about 80% mat rounders, 10% longball dodgeball cricket, 5% badminton, 4% netball and the remaining 1% will be whatever the curriculum actually states what you should do.</p>
<p>If you are a boy, your lessons will be mostly football or basketball.</p>
<p>In Year 8 the girls get to a dance project in which they need to film a music video but then is usually never assessed despite it taking up something like half a year.</p>
<h3>Extreme Weather Conditions</h3>
<p>Snow - In this case you are often expected to go outside onto the astroturf and continue doing PE as if you aren't at threat of catching pneumonia. However, if the PE teachers are feeling particularly generous, you may find yourself in the hall with 90 other people doing Just Dance.</p>
