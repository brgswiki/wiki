<h2>Maths</h2>
<p>One of the core subjects, where you get 6 lessons a fortnight in Year 7, 8 &amp; 9, and in Years 10 &amp; 11 you get it 7 times a fortnight - you also have the same PSHCE class as maths class.</p>
<p>Maths is the only subject in which you are put in sets each year.</p>
<p>Maths is also the mother of the trip <a href="/groups/trips/anglesey">Anglesey</a>.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>Lessons consist of two parts. One part is where the teacher teaches you how to do whatever topic you are studying, the other part is where you work from a textbook or a loop card sheet. Both halves of the lesson are equally boring. If you are very lucky you may be allowed to talk during the textbook work or your teacher might put on some music (Mrs Chapman in particular).</p>
