<h2>Maths</h2>
<p>One of the core subjects, although debated why it is actually a core subject since you seem to only learn the ever useful skills of circle theorem proofs or trigonometry - abilities we will need in our adult day to day lives without a doubt.</p>
<p>Maths is the only subject in which you are put in sets each year.</p>
<p>The <a href="/students/intake19">Year 8</a> trip to <a href="/groups/trips/anglesey">Anglesey</a> is a maths trip.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>Lessons consist of two parts. One part is where the teacher teaches you how to do whatever topic you are studying, the other part is where you work from a textbook or a loop card sheet. Both halves of the lesson are equally boring. If you are very lucky you may be allowed to talk during the textbook work or your teacher might put on some music (Mrs Chapman in particular).</p>
