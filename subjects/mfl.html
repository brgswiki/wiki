<h2>MFL</h2>
<p>A language is a compulsory subject until <a href="/students/intake15">year 11</a>. This subject teaches you many handy phrases that would come up in almost every conversation in another country, for example "erfrieren" or "Doppelhaus" or "Ozonlos".</p>
<p>If you join <a href="/students/intake19">Year 7</a> in an even numbered year you study German and Spanish, and if you join in an odd numbered year you do German and French. Doing this just means BRGS needs to employ more teachers and buy more textbooks etc so no one really knows why they have done this.</p>
<p>The Head of Languages is Mr Wyton, and despite saying he will retire in 2020 he has also claimed that he is coming back to teach his <a href="/students/intake16">Year 10</a> class. If Mr Wyton ever leaves the MFL department will be the second all female teacher department following English. Every year a language teacher or two leaves only to be replaced with about 5 new ones. Maybe they're building an army?</p>
