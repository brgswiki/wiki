<h2>PSHCE</h2>
<p>This is the subject where you learn about all those 'life lessons' like how to put nappies on a baby doll or trying to type whilst wearing goggles that make it seem as if you are drunk. PSHCE is quite fun from Year 7 to 9 but then all of a sudden the topics become deep and a bit depressing.</p>
<p>Regrettably the curriculum seems to be avoiding important topics in favour of the classic “anti-cyber-bullying” for 3 years straight. Evidence for this includes a Year 7 being asked what a particular item (a tampon) was and them looking horrified, lowering their voice to make sure no one else could hear, and then asking “Cannabis?”.</p>
