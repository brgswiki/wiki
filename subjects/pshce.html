<h2>PSHCE</h2>
<p>This is the subject where you learn about all those 'life lessons' like how to put nappies on a baby doll or trying to type whilst wearing goggles that make it seem as if you are drunk. PSHCE is quite fun from Year 7 to 9 but then all of a sudden the topics become deep and a bit depressing.</p>
