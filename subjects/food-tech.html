<h2>Food Technology</h2>
<p>You get food tech a term each year in <a href="/students/intake20">Years 7</a> &amp; 8, and in <a href="/students/intake18">Year 9</a> you get it two terms as it takes over from <a href="/subjects/textiles">textiles</a>. Food tech is fun as you get to just chat and laugh about how badly your practical is going, and in the unlikely event your practical actually turns out nice then even better, as you can just laugh at how badly other peoples' practicals are going.</p>
<p>The best practicals by far are cheese scones and the tear &amp; share bread, although the first practicals of sandwich and fruit salad are difficult to <s>beat</s> <i>defend.</i></p>
