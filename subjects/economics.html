<h2>Economics</h2>
<p>Very similar to business studies - in fact so similar those taking it are unlikely to even know the difference and so to be safe place both subjects on their A-Level form.</p>
<p>Like business studies, you can only study economics at A-Level, presumably to hinder lower school students from learning those hush hush entrepreneurial money making schemes and forcing them to stay on at sixth form should they wish to learn such secrets.</p>
