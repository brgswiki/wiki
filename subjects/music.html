<h2>Music</h2>
<p>Music lessons are a wonderful way to let off any creative steam, either by constantly pressing the DJ button for half an hour or by strumming a ukelele imagining it sounds good (it doesn't, especially to classes nearby who have to put up with a bunch of year 7s playing out of tune).</p>
<h3>Unappreciated Talent?</h3>
<p>Teachers in the <a href="/subjects/art">art</a> block or <a href="/subjects/geography">geography</a> classrooms often complain about the quality of music carried though the air. One teacher has been heard remarking all of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Thank god they don't give those Year 7s violins!"</li>
  <li>"Why on earth did I choose this room??"</li>
  <li>"You know those plastic recorders they give to little kids at birthday parties..."</li>
  <li>"Why can't they play anything else? The number of times I've heard 'Can you feel the love tonight' today if I have to hear it once more I'll..."</li>
  <li>(Whilst the class is working in silence and you can just hear a student literally just bashing the piano keys) "I mean sometimes the music is good... but most of the day I have to put up with <i>this racket."</i></li>
</ul>
