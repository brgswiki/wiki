<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>A subject that gets progressively harder as you go through the years. At GCSE it is the most content packed science and therefore each year you have it five times a fortnight, whereas <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> and <a href="/subjects/chemistry">chemistry</a> have an hour less for one year.</p>
<p>The number of booklets you get during the biology GCSE course amounts to somewhere between a typical small British woodland and a large tropical rainforest's worth of paper.</p>
