<p>Drama lessons often feel very long as they usually consist of <a href="/teachers/past/mrs-fowler-gibbs">Mrs Fowler-Gibbs</a> spending the majority of the lesson to explain what you are supposed to be doing. In fact, it is said that drama lessons are so long, some animals have a shorter life cycle than one.</p>
