<p>Drama lessons often feel very long as they usually consist of <a href="/teachers/past/mrs-fowler-gibbs">Mrs Fowler-Gibbs</a> spending the majority of the lesson to explain what you are supposed to be doing. In fact, it is said that drama lessons are so long, some animals have a shorter life cycle than one.</p>
<p>Year 7 - This year often revolves around 'conscience corridors' and 'hot seating'. At some point you may do an actual performance but this is unlikely.</p>
<p>Year 8 - This year is all about 'melodrama' and 'comedia del arte' (whatever those may be) meaning you pretend to be some Victorian hero/villain. Notably, this year also contains the 'Murder in the Billiard Room' performance, which takes up a good 98.3% of the year.</p>
<p>Year 9 - A much more relaxed year, where you may even have 2 separate drama classes. One is focused around Shakespeare (<a href="/subjects/mfl">language</a> class) whereas your normal class is just whatever the teacher feels like doing.</p>
