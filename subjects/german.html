<h2>German</h2>
<p>German is the <a href="/subjects/mfl">language</a> that every year takes until at least <a href="/students/intake18">Year 8</a>, regardless of which year you joined in. In Year 8 you can choose whether you'd rather do German or Spanish/French (of if you are particularly languages inclined you can do both but be warned this means after school classes in <a href="/students/intake17">Year 9</a>).</p>
<p>For German you get to learn lots of useful and handy phrases such as 'gemeinsame Spritzenbenützung' or 'Drogenabhängiger'.</p>
<p>The German department has possibly the nicest teachers and is almost comparable to the <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> department in percentage of chill teachers. Unfortunately, the poor German department are left with much worse <a href="/groups/rooms">classrooms</a> and textbooks that likely date back to the 60s if the cover is anything to go by.</p>
