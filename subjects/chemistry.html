<h2>Chemistry</h2>
<p>A subject that is mostly just an excuse to use a Bunsen burner for practicals, and despite the lack of risk in most of these you need to wear goggles and lab coat for pretty much each one.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/students/intake17">Year 9</a> is where you start studying chemistry as a separate lesson rather than 'science' as a whole, and for the majority of the year you get to draw on paper then stick it in water to see what happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From <a href="/students/intake16">Year 10</a> chemistry lessons go from 2 lessons a fortnight to 5, and begins to get very mathsy and therefore many lose motivation. Chemistry is taught in <a href="/groups/rooms/science/1">Room 1</a>, <a href="/groups/rooms/science/3">Room 3</a>, <a href="/groups/rooms/science/5">Room 5</a> and Room 12.</p>
<p>The BRGS Chemistry Twitter can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/BRGS_Chemistry">here</a>, although it hasn't been active for some time now.</p>
<p>The chemistry department is no doubt overshadowed by the competing <a href="/subjects/physics">physics</a> department, but do not be deceived - the chemistry department are catching up and will perhaps someday in the not too distant future also be famed for being (almost) equally relaxed &amp; chill.</p>
