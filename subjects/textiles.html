<p>Textiles is a subject only taken in Year 7 and 8, supposedly because it is a useful skill to have in the future. Saying that, I am yet to see any adults making a pillow or pencil case for themselves over 3 months that falls apart after a week.</p>
<p>The textiles room is locked whenever not in use (most days) although burglars would likely rather go after laptops and computers than some old sewing machines and felt.</p>
<h3>Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Year 7 - Pencil Case &amp; Phone Case</li>
  <li>Year 8 - Choice of <i>at least</i> one project, from a range of ideas supplied by Mrs Reynard. These include a Teddy Bear, a Mug Rug, Hessian Bag and more.</li>
</ul>
