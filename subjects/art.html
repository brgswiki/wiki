<h2>Art</h2>
<p>Art is a subject that often takes up most of your free-time whenever you get homework. If you have a cactus at the start of the year, by the end of year it will probably will have died due to neglect in favour of your art <a href="/other/homework">homework</a>. You will be more neglectful than <i>a desert</i>.</p>
<p>Often the topics chosen are possibly the least interesting that they could have done. In particular, anyone who has had to study 'futurism' has found themselves cursing each time they had an art lesson the whole topic. Plus, who wants to have to draw a shoe for their first art lesson at BRGS - not the nicest way to introduce petrified Year 7s to Art.</p>
<p>The new <a href="/groups/places/art-block">art block</a> is now possible the nicest area in school (although this is mostly down to A101's large windows that provide a view of the main building's dingy science stairs).</p>
