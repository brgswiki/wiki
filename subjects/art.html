<p>Art is a subject that often takes up most of your free-time whenever you get homework. Often the topics chosen are possibly the least interesting that they could have done. In particular, anyone who has had to study 'futurism' has found themselves cursing each time they had an art lesson the whole topic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new art block is now possible the nicest area in school (although this is mostly down to A101's large windows that provide a view of the main building's dingy science stairs).</p>
