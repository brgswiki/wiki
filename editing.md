> Editing content on the Wiki might seem daunting at first, but its actually really easy! Just follow these guidelines and you'll be helping the Wiki grow in no time.
{.is-info}

### General guidelines

- Always edit the Wiki from a desktop/laptop, don't use your phone because it won't format things properly
- Don't delete the work of other users without a clear justification
- Use good English and don't use rude language (for more details on this [please see our rules](/rules))
> **If you have *any* problems, concerns or questions *at all* just email [support@brgswiki.tk](mailto:support@brgswiki.tk) or DM us on our Instagram account (brgswiki) and we will be happy to help and get back to you ASAP.**
> Don't worry, we're super friendly, and we won't get mad if you broke something
(it's better to just let us know so we can fix it, we take backups of the site every 5 minutes so it's an easy job)

### Creating a new page

- 9 times out of 10, there will already be a 'red' link to the page you want to create, for example a teacher link on the homepage. Look for a button like this: <br>
  <ul class="links-list"><li><a class="is-internal-link is-invalid-page">Name of page</a></li></ul>
- Clicking on that will take you to a message saying `This page does not exist yet`. Simply click `Create page` to get started.
- When asked what editor you want to use, choose `Visual Editor` - even if you are comfortable using Markdown, others who want to edit the page later might not be.
- Set the page title to the same as the red link you clicked, and add a suitable description.
- Add suitable tags eg. what subject a teacher teaches, etc.

> Unsure what to add? Check out [this page](/editing/helpful-tips).

### Formatting a page

- A page should start with text in the size `Paragraph`, and subsequent sections should use `Heading 3`
- Quotes should use the `blockquote` button to achieve the following style:

> This is an example of a quote

- If you mention something that is covered by another page, eg. another teacher, please create a link as follows:
  - Select the text you want to link and click the `link` button (or press `ctrl` + `K`)
  - Add the relevant link (you don't need the brgswiki part of the url, for example a link could be `/teachers/mr-porteous`
  
### Adding images
If you wish, you can add an image to your page - after all, a picture speaks a thousand words!
- Please upload images to the wiki directly, do not link to images on other sites because those links could expire
- Before uploading an image, please make sure it isn't too large, anywhere around 300-800px width is great, you can resize it at https://imageresizer.com/, this helps to ensure no bandwidth is wasted.
- Even if the image is already a suitable size, please compress it either at the link above or at https://compresspng.com/ or https://compressjpeg.com/ depending on the file format.

<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/ms-marti_grammar-king.jpg"><figcaption>A lovely example image</figcaption></figure>

- To insert an image, choose `Insert Assets`, and either choose an image from the file list on the left, or upload one by:
  - Ensuring the image is properly named, eg. `mr-porteous.png` instead of `screenshot-1234Hlsjdf.png`.
  - Click the large `Browse or Drop files here...` button to select your files. (Or just drop them onto the button).
  - Click `Upload`.
  - Your image(s) should now appear in the library on the left, click on it and then choose `Insert`.
    - If you can't see your image click twice on the header of the `Added` column to sort images by date added.
- Preferably, choose `Right aligned image` from the tooltip (it looks way nicer) and if possible **do not** resize the image, so it is easier to view on mobile devices.
