<h2>Get Started</h2>
<p>Unsure what to add to a page? Well, you came to the right place! If you're needing inspiration or ideas on what should be added to a new or incomplete page, read below!</p>
<h3>Teacher Pages</h3>
<p>A teacher page should first contain a brief description of the teacher, including subject and their form if you know it. In this introductory description you can chuck in anything else notable about them.</p>
<p>Afterwards, if you can think of anything, you add another section or two or three if you are feeling particularly inspired . If you are unsure on what to add here, some commonly used things include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A funny or notable story about them (<a href="/teachers/mr-porteous">example</a>)</li>
  <li>Habits or catchphrases</li>
  <li>A typical lesson with them (<a href="/teachers/past/mrs-fowler-gibbs">example</a>)</li>
  <li>An outlandish conspiracy theory (<a href="/teachers/dr-heaton">example</a>)</li>
  <li>Anything else notable that deserves more detail (<a href="/teachers/mrs-porteous">example</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There should also be a quotes section at the bottom of the page, and if possible a photo added somewhere near the top if there isn't already one.</p>
<p>Please note that if a story <i>didn't</i> happen in school or on a school trip, or a teacher hasn't told you about it themselves, please do&nbsp;<strong> <u>not</u></strong> post it on the wiki. This includes things such as previous schools etc. Any content of this nature will be considered a breach of privacy and will be removed. Depending on what has posted, you may be banned for a certain length of time or even permanently.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Student Pages</h3>
<p>Student pages are found following a number of other pages, the guide for each one can be found below in order.</p>
<h4>- <u>Intakes and Year Groups</u></h4>
<p>This is the year group as a whole. This page should include the head of year, and the year group's forms. This page can also contain any stories or notable events that have happened relating to this year group.</p>
<h4>- <u>Forms</u></h4>
<p>A form page should be made up of a list of form tutors and form rooms so far, linking them to their correct page if possible. A form page should also contain a list of all the students (in any order you wish). You can also add any stories about the form to this page, or a photo.</p>
<h4>- <u>Student Pages</u></h4>
<p>Student pages should be written in third person (ie. she/he/they rather than I/me/my) as this also allows other people such as friends to contribute to them and gives the page a more wiki feel. To this page you can add any stories (as long as the page's subject is aware and gives permission to do so) or other random little facts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are contributing to a student page that <i>isn't </i>your own, you must make sure to keep it polite and light-hearted, and only put on content they would approve of themselves. Anything that is considered inappropriate or mean spirited will result in a ban and any content you have added will be removed from the page.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>For now we kindly ask you to try and only edit your friends' pages to try and prevent as many malicious edits as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h4>- <u>Year Group Events</u></h4>
<p>Here you can add anything that has happened with this year group, in particular school trips or events of a similar nature. In these pages you can add your own photos and stories as the BRGS Website seems to be missing out a lot of photo galleries and articles.</p>
<h3>Events &amp; School Trips</h3>
<p>These pages are meant as a general description of the activity that every year who undertakes it would experience. If you wish to add any photos or recollections from a particular year please add this to your Year Group Events page. The Events page can be found <a href="/groups/events">here</a>, and the School Trips page can be found <a href="/groups/trips">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Places &amp; Rooms</h3>
<p>A general description should be added here, including location and anything else particularly notable about the room/area such as subject taught there, layout etc. A good example of a <a href="/groups/rooms">Room</a> includes <a href="/groups/rooms/science/5">Room 5</a>, and a good example of a <a href="/groups/places">place</a> includes the <a href="/groups/places/belfry">Belfry</a>.</p>
<h3>Subjects</h3>
<p>Here you can add a description of the subject, including what would might be covered in certain years. If you can, try and add a list of teachers or a description of the building where the subject is often taught in.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p>This page might include anything from a teaching object to a conspiracy theory. You can make this page about whatever you want as long as it links to BRGS and doesn't attack anyone. These pages can be found all over the old Wiki if you look around, and therefore we'd love to try and create a similar thing on here. An example of this type of page can be found <a href="/subjects/physics/physics-cat">here</a>.</p>
