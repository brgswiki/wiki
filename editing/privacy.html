<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>We do have a couple of rules in place specifically to protect students' and staffs' privacies. Please respect these.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Please be aware that this website is intended for events and anecdotes about BRGS, specifically <strong><u>at school</u></strong> (or on school trips). It isn't a gossip site and should not be used to post information about peoples' personal lives, both students and teachers. Any information posted that isn't <i>directly</i> related to the school and its occupants will be removed, and the poster warned. If a teacher has told you a story in lesson (even if it isn't related to BRGS) you can still share it, just as long as they have told you the story themselves.</li>
  <li>This rule covers any information about lives, including where someone was born, email addresses, mobile phone numbers and so forth. Adding these details to the site (<i>even if they are your own details!</i>) is a breach of this policy and will result in a reprimand from the moderators/admins.</li>
  <li>Also, please ensure that <i>rumours</i> about teachers, students etc are <i>NOT</i> posted. We understand that some people may have no issue with certain facts being made public, but as we cannot verify who is behind a username, we cannot possibly know if the person in question has given their consent. This is not Facebook after all, and the site must be kept factual and relevant to school life. If you are unsure what to put, have a go on the old BRGS Wiki 'random page' link - you'll usually come across some good examples of what to put on a student page!</li>
</ul>
<p>As ever, if you have any issues or concerns regarding anything on the site feel free to contact us via Instagram or send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@brgswiki.tk?subject=BRGS%20Wiki%20Support%3A%20%5Byour%20query%20here%5D&amp;body=Hi%20there%2C%0D%0A%0D%0A">support@brgswiki.tk</a> - we will be more than happy to help and can alter/delete pages if necessary!</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can also find our privacy policy <a href="https://brgswiki.tk/en/privacy">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
