<h2>Wiki Hierarchy</h2>
<p>This is a brief overview of how the wiki works, and what each user can do. The overall wiki philosophy is to have a collaborative effort among peers, however there are some administrative roles that are required as we would like to meet our editorial guidelines and avoid spam. For these reasons, the hierarchy exists.</p>
<h3><strong>Guests</strong></h3>
<p>This is the default for people viewing the site who haven't registered an account yet. You can view the Wiki but you can't make any edits. Similarly, guests cannot make any comments as there is no account to ban if the messages are rude or insulting.</p>
<h3>Users</h3>
<p>If you wish to make changes, sign up for a free user account (the link is on the top right hand side of the page). Please, only sign up for an account if you wish to make a positive contribution, it's very easy to ban people who want to come and vandalise the site.</p>
<p>Before registering, please have a read through our <a href="/editing">editing guidelines</a> and <a href="/rules">rules</a>.</p>
<p>Registered users can alter <i>most</i> pages. Some pages like the Home Page are locked though to avoid spam. If you have a recommended edit then please add it to the comments below, or you can contact us via Direct Message on Instagram ( at brgswiki) or email us at <a href="mailto:support@brgswiki.tk?subject=BRGS%20Wiki%20Support%3A%20%5Byour%20query%20here%5D&amp;body=Hi%20there%2C%0D%0A%0D%0A">support@brgswiki.tk</a>. Unfortunately, the registration process is necessary to make the wiki manageable.</p>
<h3>Editors</h3>
<p>Editors are very similar to users. You can apply to become an editor although please note that if you haven't made a large number of positive contributions to the BRGS Wiki your application may be denied as we cannot be sure that you won't just vandalise the site.</p>
<p>Editors are active users who have proven that they can be sensible and add thoughtful additions to the Wiki. Editors can access more pages than just regular users, in particular pages that may be locked to edits by other users. They are expected to patrol the site and keep and eye out for any vandalism or spelling/grammar errors, or just tidy up anything that looks a little unruly.</p>
<p>Editors can also delete any comments they deem rude or unnecessary, or to tidy up a comment section of a page that's beginning to get full and untidy.</p>
<h3>Moderators</h3>
<p>Moderators or mods are appointed to keep an eye on the Wiki, and frequently check edits are up to the editorial standard. They have the power to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ban users who are repeatedly defacing the site or spamming.</li>
  <li>Can read and edit <strong>all </strong>pages, even those locked to editors and general users.</li>
  <li>Delete pages that are affected by privacy concerns or contain content that is mostly contrary to the editorial guidelines.</li>
  <li>Set and edit restricted pages due to spam concerns or edit warring.</li>
  <li>Authorise &amp; create new users.</li>
  <li>Read the site's edit history and edit assets and the navigation bar.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="/editing/hierarchy/moderator-policy">Moderator Policy</a> for more details on becoming a Moderator.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that we expect very high standards from our Mods, and it is a large responsibility to take on. Moderators can have their status revoked for abusing their position, and negative edits are viewed <i>much</i> more harshly than for general users. Mods should lead by example after all!</p>
<h3>Admins</h3>
<p>These are essentially "Super-Mods". They can do everything a moderator can do, and are responsible for deciding who should become a mod. As ever, these members are bound by the same rules as everyone else. In case of argument, the Webmaster is <u>Le Admin</u> - his decision is final in all cases. Furthermore, he has final say on promoting someone to Admin status.</p>
<p>Admins are appointed very rarely, as there is no need for several members to have this status. At present, there is not much requirement for more Admins on the site, so you will only reach this level in exceptional circumstances!</p>
