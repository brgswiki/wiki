<h2>Moderator Policy</h2>
<p>If you are interested in becoming an editor or a moderator, please contact us at support@brgswiki.tk or via the<a href="https://www.instagram.com/brgswiki/"> brgswiki </a>instagram page to register your interest with the admins. Please include what year you are in, your name, your Wiki username, and anything special you could add to the wiki. One of the admins may send you an invite, via email or DM, when more moderators are needed or if a specific role can be filled in the site.</p>
<p>These are a few of the qualities we look for. It is not an exhaustive checkbox-style list.</p>
<h3>Good Things</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Many good edits</li>
  <li>High quality of posts - good standard of English etc</li>
  <li>On the wiki regularly</li>
  <li>Made a positive contribution to the wiki</li>
  <li>Following all of the rules, and generally leading by example</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bad Things</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Any previous bans</li>
  <li>Any arguments or feuds</li>
  <li>Failing to adhere to the <a href="/editing">editing guidelines</a> or <a href="/rules">rules</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a moderator brings with it a large amount of responsibility in terms of setting an example. You must be committed, impartial and capable of enforcing the rules as correctly and fairly as is practical. Mod status does not last for life; if you abuse this privilege your status will be revoked!</p>
