<h1>About Us</h1>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>The Wiki is a (generally satirical) site, all about BRGS and its various ongoings. Its main purpose is to serve as an archive for student anecdotes, in particular as the official BRGS website is missing photo galleries and articles for a number of events over the past few years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The meme pages provide a platform for student opinion, as the school itself has no official outlets for students. As a result BRGS SLT and staff have turned to the meme pages on a number of occasions in order for honest ‘survey’ like responses from students on various aspects of student life.&nbsp;</p>
