# Policies
> Welcome to our policy hub, where you can find up-to-date information on everything regarding the BRGS Wiki!
{.is-info}

> **The content here is still a work-in-progress.** Eventually, this will replace our existing rules pages.
{.is-warning}

*The BRGS Wiki* is first and foremost an archive and knowledge base about BRGS, and intends to present up-to-date and useful information in a fun, light-hearted manner. Our pages help thousands of people to get a 'feel' for BRGS, whether it be through our interactive map, or through reading teacher quotes.

The Wiki is not intended to harm, intimidate, defame, or bully the staff of BRGS in any way, and we regularly review content to ensure that it complies with all our policies and editing guidelines, portraying staff in the good light they deserve.

We believe everyone has a fundamental right to privacy, and we value it deeply. That's why we don't collect invasive data from users of our services, and don't give it away to third parties. You can read more in [our privacy policy](/privacy).

Of course, we also endevour to protect the privacy of staff, by implementing rules which define what content is allowed and what isn't.

If a member of staff wishes that their wiki page is removed from search engine results, they can contact us at [support@brgswiki.org](mailto:support@brgswiki.org), and we will be happy to comply with their request as soon as possible.

Additionally, if you find any content on the wiki that you believe to be in breach of our rules, please contact us and we will review it, and remove or ammend it if necessary. Depending on the rules broken, we may impose sanctions on the user(s) who published the offending content.

## Content rules
- **Do not write about events that didn't happen at school,** or during a school trip. This means stories or rumours about the personal lives' of teachers are not permitted on the wiki, and such content will be removed without prior notice. The only exception to this rule is stories that a teacher has directly told in a lesson.
- **Do not violate anyone's personal privacy.** This includes the publication of private details, such as email addresses, social media usernames, etc., including your own.
- **Do not write content which could be deemed as offensive**, or that attacks members of staff. If you are unsure about whether something is appropriate or not, it probably isn't. If you're unsure, please get in touch.
- **Do not use photographs of staff taken unconsensually.** This means images taken by students at school, without their knowledge. It is also disrespectful to a member of staff's privacy to use images of them taken from sites such as personal Facebook profiles without their explicit consent, even though these images may technically be publicly available.
- **Do not write about students.** If a quote about a teacher includes a student, please refer to them in the quote as 'Student'. Publishing the names or other details of any BRGS students is unacceptable.
- **Do not rewrite quotes so that they are untrue,** for example, dramatising a quote such that it gains more attention. This could result in claims of defamation, and lying is simply immoral and rude to the member of staff involved.
- **Always check for correct grammar and spelling.** Please remember that the Wiki is not a Tumblr blog or an Instagram post, and we aim to only publish well-written content to help retain our reputation as the go-to place for accurate information about BRGS.

## Sanctions
If offending content is found, our response will differ base on the severity of the content. For example, a more minor offence may incur a written warning and correction on the first occurance, with a potential for blocks and bans to be implemented on any further or more serious offences. If circumstances require it, pages can be locked for a period of time so that only approved administrators can make changes. Additionally, our administrative team is notified when any edits are made, and as such we can review them.

> If you have any queries about any of this information, or the Wiki as a whole, please contact us at [support@brgswiki.org](mailto:support@brgswiki.org), and our team will be more than happy to help you with your concern or request.
